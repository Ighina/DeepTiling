========,1,preface.
Singular "they" is the use in English of the pronoun "they" or its inflected or derivative forms, "them", "their", "theirs", and "themselves" (or "themself"), as an epicene (gender-neutral) singular pronoun.
It typically occurs with an antecedent of indeterminate gender, as in sentences such as:
***LIST***.
The singular "they" had emerged by the 14th century and is common in everyday spoken English, but its use has been the target of criticism since the late 19th century.
Its use in formal English has increased with the trend toward gender-inclusive language.
========,2,Inflected forms and derivative pronouns.
Though the "singular "they"" permits a singular antecedent, it is used with a plural verb form.
Singular "they" has mostly the same inflected forms as the plural "they" (i.e.
"them", "their", and "theirs"), with variation in the reflexive form.
The plural reflexive form "themselves" is sometimes used for the singular, but there is an alternative singular reflexive form, "themself".
"Themself" was common from the 14th to 16th centuries and its use has increased since about the 1970s or 1980s, but it was classified by the 2015 edition of "Fowler's" as "a minority form" and its use in standard dialect was described by "The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language" as "rare and acceptable only to a minority of speakers".
Its use is thought to be increasing.
It is sometimes used when referring to a single person of indeterminate gender, where the plural form "themselves" might seem incongruous, as in
***LIST***.
The Canadian government recommends "themselves" as the reflexive form of singular "they" for use in Canadian federal legislative texts and advises against using "themself", but "themself" is also found:
***LIST***.
========,2,Usage.
"They" with a singular antecedent has remained in common use for centuries in spite of its proscription by traditional grammarians.
Such use goes back to the Middle English of the 14th century.
Informal spoken English exhibits nearly universal use of the singular "they".
An examination by Jürgen Gerner of the British National Corpus published in 1998 found that British speakers regardless of social status, age, sex, or region used the singular "they" overwhelmingly more often than the gender-neutral "he" or other options.
========,3,Trend to prescription of generic "he" from 19th century.
Preferring "he" as a gender-neutral pronoun, nineteenth-century grammarians insisted on a singular pronoun on the grounds of number agreement, while rejecting "he or she" as clumsy.
A recommendation to use the generic "he", rather than "they", in formal English can be found as early as the mid-18th century, in Ann Fisher's "A New Grammar", where she writes:
An 1895 grammar (Baskervill, W.M.
and Sewell, J.W.
: "An English Grammar for the Use of High School, Academy and College Class") notes the common use of the singular "they" but recommends use of the generic "he", on the basis of number agreement:
Baskervill gives a number of examples of recognized authors using the singular "they", including
***LIST***.
but prefers the use of "he":
—Baskervill, An English Grammar In 1850, the British Parliament passed an act which provided that, when used in acts of Parliament "words importing the masculine gender shall be deemed and taken to include females".
It has been argued that the real motivation for promoting the "generic" "he" was an androcentric world view, with the default sex of humans being male – and the default gender therefore being masculine.
As Wilson wrote in 1560
***LIST***.
and Poole wrote in 1646
***LIST***.
In spite of continuous attempts on the part of educationalists to proscribe singular "they" in favour of "he", its use remained widespread, and the advice was largely ignored, even by writers of the period, though the advice may have been observed more by American writers.
Use of the purportedly gender-neutral "he" remained acceptable until at least the 1960s, though some uses of "he" were later criticized as being awkward or silly, for instance when referring to:
***LIST***.
========,3,Contemporary use of "he" to refer to a generic or indefinite antecedent.
"He" is still sometimes found in contemporary writing when referring to a generic or indeterminate antecedent.
In some cases it is clear from the situation that the persons potentially referred to are likely to be male, as in
***LIST***.
In some cases the antecedent may refer to persons who are only "probably" male or to occupations traditionally thought of as male:
***LIST***.
In other situations, the antecedent may refer to:
***LIST***.
In 2010, we still find the use of generic "he" recommended:
In 2015, "Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage" calls this "the now outmoded use of "he" to mean 'anyone'", stating
========,3,Trend to gender-neutral language.
The earliest known attempt to create gender-neutral pronouns dates back to 1792, when Scottish economist James Anderson advocated for an indeterminate pronoun "ou".
In 1808, poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote:"whether we may not, nay ought not, to use a neutral pronoun, relative or representative, to the word "Person", where it hath been used in the sense of homo, mensch, or noun of the common gender, in order to avoid particularising man or woman, or in order to express either sex indifferently?
If this be incorrect in syntax, the whole use of the word Person is lost in a number of instances, or only retained by some stiff and strange position of the words, as – "not letting the person be aware wherein offense has been given" – instead of – "wherein he or she has offended".
In my [judgment] both the specific intention and general etymon of "Person" in such sentences fully authorise the use of it and which instead of he, she, him, her, who, whom."
--Samuel Taylor Coleridge, as written in Anima Poetæ: From the Unpublished Note-books of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, edited by Ernest Coleridge (1895), p. 190.
In the second half of the 20th century, people expressed more widespread concern at the use of sexist and male-oriented language.
This included criticism of the use of "man" as a generic term to include men and women and of the use of "he" to refer to any human, regardless of sex (social gender).
It was argued that "he" could not sensibly be used as a generic pronoun understood to include men and women.
William Safire in his "On Language" column in "The New York Times" approved of the use of generic "he", mentioning the mnemonic phrase "the male embraces the female".
C. Badendyck from Brooklyn wrote to the "New York Times" in a reply:
By 1980, the movement had gained wide support, and many organizations, including most publishers, had issued guidelines on the use of gender-neutral language.
========,4,Use for specific, known people.
In some situations, an individual may be known but referred to using the pronoun "they".
This may occur because the individual's gender is unknown to the speaker, or because the gender is non-binary or genderqueer, so that they regard both masculine and feminine pronouns as inappropriate and thus prefer to be referred to as "they".
Several social media applications permit account holders to choose to identify their gender using one of a variety of non-binary or genderqueer options, such as "gender fluid", "agender", or "bigender", and to designate a pronoun, including "they"/"them", which they wish to be used when referring to them.
Though "singular "they"" has long been used with antecedents like "everybody" or generic persons of unknown gender, this use, which may be chosen by an individual, is recent.
It was chosen by the American Dialect Society as the Word of the Year 2015, in the meaning "gender-neutral singular pronoun for a known person, as a non-binary identifier".
In 2016, the American Dialect Society wrote:
The vote followed the previous year's approval of this use by "The Washington Post" style guide, when Bill Walsh, the "Post"s copy editor said that the singular "they" is "the only sensible solution to English's lack of a gender-neutral third-person singular personal pronoun".
========,3,Contemporary usage.
The use of masculine generic nouns and pronouns in written and spoken language has decreased since the 1970s.
In a corpus of spontaneous speech collected in Australia in the 1990s, singular "they" had become the most frequently used generic pronoun.
Similarly, a study from 2002 looking at a corpus of American and British newspapers showed a preference for "they" to be used (rather than generic "he" or "he or she") as a singular epicene pronoun.
The increased use of singular "they" may owe in part to an increasing desire for gender-neutral language.
A solution in formal writing has often been to write "he or she", or something similar, but this is often considered awkward or overly politically correct, particularly when used excessively.
In 2016, the journal "American Speech" published a study by Darren K. LaScotte investigating the pronouns used by native English speakers in informal written responses to questions concerning a subject of unspecified gender, finding that 68% of study participants chose singular "they" to refer to such an antecedent.
Some participants noted that they found constructions such as "he or she" inadequate as they do not include people who do not identify as either male or female.
In contemporary usage, singular "they" is used to refer to an indeterminate antecedent, for instance when the notional gender or number of the antecedent is indeterminate or the gender of the real-word entity referred to is unknown or unrevealed.
Examples include different types of usage.
========,4,Use with a pronoun antecedent.
========,5,Notional plurality or pairwise relationships.
Although the pronouns "everybody", "everyone", "nobody", and "no one" are singular in form and are used with a singular verb, these pronouns have an "implied plurality" that is somewhat similar to the implied plurality of collective or group nouns such as "crowd" or "team", and in some sentences where the antecedent is one of these "implied plural" pronouns, the word "they" cannot be replaced by generic "he", suggesting a "notional plural" rather than a "bound variable" interpretation.
In contrast to sentences that involve multiple pairwise relationships and singular "they" such as
***LIST***.
There are examples where the antecedent pronoun (such as "everyone") may refer to a collective, with no necessary implication of pairwise relationships.
These are examples of plural "they":
***LIST***.
Which are apparent because they do not work with a generic "he" or "he or she": 
***LIST***.
In addition, for these "notional plural" cases, it would not be appropriate to use "themself" instead of "themselves" as in:
***LIST***.
========,2,Acceptability and prescriptive guidance.
Though both generic "he" and generic "they" have long histories of use, and both are still used, both are also systematically avoided by particular groups.
Style guides that avoid expressing a preference for either approach sometimes recommend recasting a problem sentence, for instance replacing generic expressions with plurals to avoid the criticisms of either party.
The use of singular "they" may be more accepted in British English than in American English, or vice versa.
========,3,Usage guidance in British–American style guides.
"The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing" by Casey Miller and Kate Swift was first published in the United States.
Because of differences in culture and vocabulary, separate British editions have since been published.
These authors accept or recommend singular uses of "they" not just in cases where there is an element of semantic plurality expressed by a word such as "everyone" but also where an indeterminate "person" is referred to, citing examples of such usage even in formal speech.
For instance, they quote Ronald Reagan:
***LIST***.
In addition to use of singular "they", they – and others – also suggest a number of ways to avoid "the pronoun problem" in gender-neutral writing.
One strategy is to rewrite the sentence to use a plural "they".
For instance, in a newspaper story
***LIST***.
could have been changed to
***LIST***.
Another strategy is to eliminate the pronoun; so
***LIST***.
***LIST***.
Other methods of avoiding gender preference include recasting a sentence to use "one", or (for babies) "it".
========,3,Usage guidance in American style guides.
"Garner's Modern American Usage" (2003) recommends cautious use of singular "they", and avoidance where possible because its use is stigmatized.
***LIST***.
Garner suggests that use of singular "they" is more acceptable in British English:
***LIST***.
and apparently regrets the resistance by the American language community:
***LIST***.
He regards the trend toward using singular "they" with antecedents like "everybody", "anyone" and "somebody" as inevitable:
***LIST***.
In the 14th edition (1993) of "The Chicago Manual of Style", the University of Chicago Press explicitly recommended using singular "they" and "their", noting a "revival" of this usage and citing "its venerable use by such writers as Addison, Austen, Chesterfield, Fielding, Ruskin, Scott, and Shakespeare."
From the 15th edition (2003), this was changed.
In Chapter 5 of the 16th edition (2010), now written by Bryan A. Garner, the recommendations are:
and According to "The American Heritage Book of English Usage", many Americans avoid use of "they" to refer to a singular antecedent out of respect for a "traditional" grammatical rule, despite use of singular "they" by modern writers of note and mainstream publications:
The "Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association" explicitly reject the use of singular "they" and gives the following example as "incorrect" usage:
***LIST***.
while also specifically taking the position that generic "he" is unacceptable.
The APA recommends using "he or she", recasting the sentence with a plural subject to allow correct use of "they", or simply rewriting the sentence to avoid issues with gender or number.
Strunk & White, the authors of "The Elements of Style", find use of "they" with a singular antecedent unacceptable:
Their assessment, in 1979, was
Joseph M. Williams, who wrote a number of books on writing with "", discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various solutions when faced with the problem of referring to an antecedent such as "someone", "everyone", "no one" or a noun that does not indicate gender and suggests that this will continue to be a problem for some time.
He "suspect[s] that eventually we will accept the plural "they" as a correct singular" but states that currently "formal usage requires a singular pronoun".
According to "The Little, Brown Handbook", most experts—and some teachers and employers—find use of singular "they" unacceptable:
It recommends using "he or she" or avoiding the problem by rewriting the sentence to use a plural or omit the pronoun.
The "Purdue Online Writing Lab" (OWL) maintains that singular "they" is incorrect:
"The Washington Post" style manual, , recommends trying to "write around the problem, perhaps by changing singulars to plurals, before using the singular they as a last resort" and specifically permits use of "they" for a "gender-nonconforming person".
The Associated Press Stylebook, , recommends: "They/them/their is acceptable in limited cases as a singular and-or gender-neutral pronoun, when alternative wording is overly awkward or clumsy.
However, rewording usually is possible and always is preferable."
========,3,Usage guidance in British style guides.
In the first edition of "A Dictionary of Modern English Usage" (published in 1926) it is stated that singular "they" is disapproved of by grammarians and should be avoided in favour of the generic "he".
Examples of its use by eminent writers are given, but it is suggested that "few good modern writers would flout [grammarians] so conspicuously as Fielding and Thackeray", whose sentences are described as having an "old-fashioned sound".
In the second edition of Fowler's, "Fowler's Modern English Usage" (edited by Sir Ernest Gowers and published in 1965), it is stated that singular "they" is disapproved of by grammarians and, while common in colloquial speech, should preferably be avoided in favour of the generic "he" in prose.
Numerous examples of its use by eminent writers are given, but it is still suggested that "few good modern writers would flout [grammarians] so conspicuously as Fielding and Thackeray".
According to the third edition of Fowler's ("The New Fowler's Modern English Usage", edited by Burchfield and published in 1996) singular "they" has not only been widely used by good writers for centuries, but is now generally accepted, except by some conservative grammarians, including the Fowler of 1926, who ignored the evidence:
"The Complete Plain Words" was originally written in 1948 by Sir Ernest Gowers, a civil servant, in an attempt by the British civil service to improve "official English".
A second edition, edited by Sir Bruce Fraser, was published in 1973.
It refers to "they" or "them" as the "equivalent of a singular pronoun of common sex" as "common in speech and not unknown in serious writing " but "stigmatized by grammarians as usage grammatically indefensible.
The book's advice for "official writers" (civil servants) is to avoid its use and not to be tempted by its "greater convenience", though "necessity may eventually force it into the category of accepted idiom".
A new edition of "Plain Words", revised and updated by Sir Ernest Gowers' great granddaughter, Rebecca Gowers, was published in 2014.
It notes that singular "they" and "them" have become much more widespread since Gowers' original comments, but still finds it "safer" to treat a sentence like 'The reader may toss their book aside' as incorrect "in formal English", while rejecting even more strongly sentences like
***LIST***.
"The Times Style and Usage Guide" (first published in 2003 by "The Times" of London) recommends avoiding sentences like
***LIST***.
by using a plural construction:
***LIST***.
"The Cambridge Guide to English Usage" (2004) finds singular "they" "unremarkable":
It expresses several preferences.
***LIST***.
"The Economist Style Guide" refers to the use of "they" in sentences like
***LIST***.
as "scrambled syntax that people adopt because they cannot bring themselves to use a singular pronoun".
"New Hart's Rules" is aimed at those engaged in copy editing, and the emphasis is on the formal elements of presentation including punctuation and typeface, rather than on linguistic style but—like "The Chicago Manual of Style"—makes occasional forays into matters of usage.
It advises against use of the purportedly gender-neutral "he", and suggests cautious use of "they" where "he or she" presents problems.
The 2011 edition of the "New International Version Bible" uses singular "they" instead of the traditional "he" when translating pronouns that apply to both genders in the original Greek or Hebrew.
This decision was based on research by a commission that studied modern English usage and determined that singular "they" ("them"/"their") was by far the most common way that English-language speakers and writers today refer back to singular antecedents such as "whoever", "anyone", "somebody", "a person", "no one", and the like."
========,3,Usage guidance in English grammars.
According to "A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language" (1985):
"The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language" discusses the prescriptivist argument that "they" is a plural pronoun and that the use of "they" with a singular "antecedent" therefore violates the rule of agreement between antecedent and pronoun, but takes the view that "they", though "primarily" plural, can also be singular in a secondary "extended" sense, comparable to the purportedly extended sense of "he" to include female gender.
Use of singular "they" is stated to be "particularly common", even "stylistically neutral" with antecedents such as "everyone", "someone", and "no one", but more restricted when referring to common nouns as antecedents, as in
***LIST***.
Use of the pronoun "themself" is described as being "rare" and "acceptable only to a minority of speakers", while use of the morphologically plural "themselves" is considered problematic when referring to "someone" rather that "everyone" (since only the latter implies a plural set).
There are also issues of grammatical acceptability when reflexive pronouns refer to singular noun phrases joined by "or", the following all being problematic:
***LIST***.
On the motivation for using singular "they", "A Student's Introduction to English Grammar" states The alternative "he or she" can be "far too cumbersome", as in
***LIST***.
or even "flatly ungrammatical", as in
***LIST***.
"Among younger speakers", use of singular "they" even with definite noun-phrase antecedents finds increasing acceptance, "sidestepping any presumption about the sex of the person referred to", as in
***LIST***.
========,2,Grammatical and logical analysis.
========,3,Notional agreement.
One explanation given for some uses of "they" referring to a singular antecedent is "notional agreement", when the antecedent is seen as semantically plural: 
***LIST***.
In other words, in the Shakespeare quotation "a mother" is syntactically singular but stands for all mothers, and in the Shaw quotation "no man" is syntactically singular (demonstrated by taking the singular form "goes") but is semantically plural ("all" go [to kill] not to be killed), hence idiomatically requiring "they".
Such use, which goes back a long way, includes examples where the sex is known, as in the above examples.
========,3,Distribution.
Distributive constructions apply a "single" idea to "multiple" members of a group.
They are typically marked in English by words like "each", "every" and "any".
The simplest examples are applied to groups of two, and use words like "either" and "or"—"Would you like tea or coffee?".
Since distributive constructions apply an idea relevant to each individual in the group, rather than to the group as a whole, they are most often conceived of as singular, and a singular pronoun is used.
***LIST***.
However, many languages, including English, show ambivalence in this regard.
Because distribution also requires a group with more than one member, plural forms are sometimes used.
========,3,Referential and non-referential anaphors.
According to the traditional analysis, English personal pronouns (e.g.
"his", "her", "their") are typically used to refer backward (or forward) within a sentence to a noun phrase (which may be a simple noun).
This reference is called an "anaphoric" reference, and the referring pronoun is termed an "anaphor".
The so-called singular "they" is morphologically plural, and is accompanied by a plural verb.
However, it is often used in circumstances where an indeterminate antecedent is signified by an indefinite singular antecedent; for example,
***LIST***.
In some sentences, typically those including words like "every" or "any", the morphologically singular antecedent does not refer to a single entity but is "anaphorically linked" to the associated pronoun to indicate a set of pairwise relationships, as in the sentence:
***LIST***.
Linguists like Pinker and Huddleston explain sentences like this (and others) in terms of bound variables, a term borrowed from logic.
Pinker prefers the terms "quantifier" and "bound variable" to "antecedent" and " pronoun".
He suggests that pronouns used as "variables" in this way are more appropriately regarded as homonyms of the equivalent referential pronouns.
The word "reference" is traditionally used in two different senses:
***LIST***.
The first sense of "reference" is also known in linguistics as a rhetorical "tie" (Halliday and Hasan, Cohesion in English) and the second sense of "reference" is understood in both linguistics and in philosophy of language as the relationship between a nominal group (or noun phrase) and an entity in a perceivable or imagined world.
With a morphologically singular antecedent, there are a number of possibilities.
The following shows different types of anaphoric reference, using various pronouns, including "they":
***LIST***.
========,2,Cognitive efficiency.
A study of whether "singular "they"" is more "difficult" to understand than gendered pronouns ("In Search of Gender Neutrality: Is Singular "They" a Cognitively Efficient Substitute for Generic "He"?"
by Foertsch and Gernsbacher) found that "singular "they" is a cognitively efficient substitute for generic "he" or "she", particularly when the antecedent is nonreferential" (e.g.
"anybody", "a nurse", or "a truck driver") rather than referring to a specific person (e.g.
"a runner I knew" or "my nurse").
Clauses with singular "they" were read "just as quickly as clauses containing a gendered pronoun that matched the stereotype of the antecedent" (e.g.
"she" for a nurse and "he" for a truck driver) and "much more quickly than clauses containing a gendered pronoun that went against the gender stereotype of the antecedent".
On the other hand, when the pronoun "they" was used to refer to known individuals ("referential antecedents, for which the gender was presumably known", e.g "my nurse", "that truck driver", "a runner I knew"), reading was slowed when compared with use of a gendered pronoun consistent with the "stereotypic gender" (e.g.
"he" for a specific truck driver).
The study concluded that "... the increased use of singular "they" is not problematic for the majority of readers".
========,2,Comparison with other pronouns.
The singular and plural use of "they" can be compared with the pronoun "you", which originally was only plural, but by about 1700 replaced "thou" for singular referents, while retaining the plural verb form.
For "you", the singular reflexive pronoun ("yourself") is different from its plural reflexive pronoun ("yourselves"); with "they" one can hear either "themself" or "themselves" for the singular reflexive pronoun.
Singular "they" has also been compared to "royal we" (also termed "editorial we"), when a single person uses first-person plural in place of first-person singular pronouns.
Similar to singular "you", its singular reflexive pronoun ("ourself") is different from the plural reflexive pronoun ("ourselves").
The pronoun "it", which is typically used for inanimate objects, can also be used for infants of unspecified gender but tends to be "dehumanizing" and is therefore more likely in a clinical context; in a more personal context, the use of "it" to refer to a person might indicate antipathy or other negative emotions.
"It" can also be used for non-human animals of unspecified gender, though "they" is common for pets and other domesticated animals of unspecified gender, especially when referred to by a proper name (e.g.
"Rags", "Snuggles").
It is uncommon to use singular "they" instead of "it" for something other than a life form.
