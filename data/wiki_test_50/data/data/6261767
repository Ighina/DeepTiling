========,1,preface.
Bob's Full House was a popular and influential quiz programme hosted by Bob Monkhouse which was based on the popular game Bingo.
It aired on BBC1 from 1 September 1984 until 27 January 1990.
========,2,Gameplay.
Four players were given separate Bingo-style cards and attempted to light up the numbers on them by answering questions.
Cards had three rows of six spaces each, with one space per row already blanked out to leave 15 numbers showing.
Numbers on the cards ran from 1 to 60.
The winner of each round received their choice of three prizes that increased in value from one round to the next.
Each episode began with a lengthy topical stand-up comedy routine from Monkhouse.
========,3,Round One (Four Corners).
In this round, Monkhouse asked toss-up questions on the buzzer, open to all.
A correct answer allowed a player to light up the number in one corner of their card, while a miss caused them to become penalized, or "wallied" - in this case, unable to buzz-in on the next question.
The first player to light all four corners of their card won the round.
========,3,Round Two (Monkhouse Master Card).
The players were shown a board with six categories, each corresponding to a range of 10 consecutive numbers.
Each player in turn called a number off their own middle row and was asked a question unopposed in the corresponding category.
A correct answer lit the number, but a miss allowed any of the other three to buzz-in (described by Monkhouse as "open to others").
A correct buzz-in allowed that player to light any number on their own middle row, while a miss caused them to become wallied.
If a wallied player was next in line to choose a number, they lost their turn; otherwise, they could not buzz-in on the next question in case of a miss.
The categories were changed out at times throughout the round.
The first player to complete their middle row won the round.
In addition, one number on each card was secretly designated as a "Lucky Number."
If the player in control chose their own Lucky Number and responded correctly, they won a bonus prize, which was revealed as part of a short comedy sketch or in connection with a worthless joke prize.
(E.g.
a contestant might win a carrot and a glass of lemon juice, then be told that they could pick up this prize during a weekend at a health farm.)
========,3,Round Three (Full House).
Gameplay proceeded as in Round One, but the goal was now to fill in all unlit numbers on the cards.
Numbers were lit starting on a player's top row and proceeding left to right, then similarly on the middle and bottom rows.
The first player to complete their card won the game and advanced to the bonus round.
Any players who finished the game without winning any prizes received a hamper of gifts as a consolation prize.
========,2,Bonus Round (Golden Card Game).
The player faced an electronic board laid out in the same manner as the cards used in the main game, with one space in each row marked off and numbers from 1 to 60 in the others.
They had 60 seconds to answer up to 15 questions.
The clock kept running on a pass or miss, but each correct answer stopped the clock and allowed the player to choose one number to be removed from the board.
Some numbers had letters hidden behind them that spelled out the name of a holiday destination, while all others added their value in pounds to a bank.
If the player uncovered all the letters, they won a holiday to that destination; if not, they received a small consolation prize.
Regardless of the outcome, they won all the money in the bank.
Monkhouse frequently offered subtle hints to help players who were struggling with questions (such as bleating like a goat to lead a player to the astrological sign of Capricorn).
The letters were arranged in order from left to right in each row, and a player who figured out the destination could narrow down the possible locations of the missing letters.
