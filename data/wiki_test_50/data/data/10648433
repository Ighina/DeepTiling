========,1,preface.
The Signal Regiment () is a regiment of the Royal Danish Army.
It was established in 1951 with the purpose of training and equipping units to support the Danish army with wartime Command, Control and Communications.
The units filled by the regiment sets up the command, control and Communications infrastructure by setting up a vehicle-based microwave radio relay network in a mesh topology.
The network is designed to be secure, encrypted and difficult to neutralize.
Besides the radio network, the regiment also establishes mobile military headquarters to be used by the army.
========,2,History.
The history of the signal regiment dates back to 1867, when the first Danish signal unit was formed; the 4th Engineering Coy.
On January 1, 1914 the company gained status of a battalion in the Engineering Regiment.
On November 1, 1947 the Ministry of Defence decided to move the signal battalion from the engineering regiment to serving directly under the Generalkommandoen.
The result was the world's first independent signal unit.
The signal battalion was later split into two battalions.
On November 1, 1951 the two battalions were given regimental status and named "Sjællandske Telegrafregiment" and "Jyske Telegrafregiment".
"Sjællandske Telegrafregiment" was attached to LAND FORCES COMMAND EAST and "Jyske Telegrafregiment" was attached to LAND FORCES COMMAND WEST.
In 1989, as the Cold War drew to a close, Parliament decided to merge the two regiments, garrisoning the resulting unit in Fredericia.
This decision was effected on January 1, 1992 and the new regiment was named "Telegrafregimentet".
========,2,Garrison.
The regiment is garrisoned in the towns of Fredericia and Haderslev.
In Fredericia, the regiment has two barracks, "Bülows Kaserne" and "Ryes Kaserne".
Bülows Kaserne is home to the school, and serves as regimental Headquarter.
Bülows Kaserne is placed in historical buildings inside the walls of the previous fortress town.
Ryes Kaserne is home to the 2nd Training Battalion, 3rd Signal Battalion and the Electronic Warfare Company.
Ryes Kaserne was built in the 1960s and borders "Hyby Fælled" Proving ground.
"Haderslev Kaserne" is home to the 5th Signal Battalion, HQCOY/1st Brigade and the Military band "Slesvigske Musikkorps".
Besides the two bases, the regiment operates Hyby Fælled Proving Ground outside Fredericia.
