========,1,preface.
Japanese particles, or , are suffixes or short words in Japanese grammar that immediately follow the modified noun, verb, adjective, or sentence.
Their grammatical range can indicate various meanings and functions, such as speaker affect and assertiveness.
========,2,Orthography and diction.
Japanese particles are written in hiragana in modern Japanese, though some of them also have kanji forms (弖 or 天 for "te" て; 爾 for "ni" に; 乎 or 遠 for "o" を; and 波 for "wa" は).
Particles follow the same rules of phonetic transcription as all Japanese words, with the exception of は (written "ha", pronounced "wa" as a particle), へ (written "he", pronounced "e") and を (written using a hiragana character with no other use in modern Japanese, originally assigned as "wo", now usually pronounced "o", though some speakers render it as "wo").
These exceptions are a relic of historical kana usage.
========,2,Types of particles.
There are eight types of particles, depending on what function they serve.
が、の、を、に、へ、と、で、から、より
か、の、や、に、と、やら、なり、だの
か、の、や、な、わ、とも、かしら
さ、よ、ね
ばかり、まで、だけ、ほど、くらい、など、なり、やら
は、も、こそ、でも、しか、さえ、だに
ば、や、が、て、のに、ので、から、ところが、けれども
の、から
Note that some particles appear in two types.
For example, "kara" is a "case marker" where it describes where something is from or what happens after something; when it describes a cause it is a "conjunctive particle".
========,2,Contrast.
========,3,に "ni" and で "de".
"Ni" and "de" can both be used to show location, corresponding to the prepositions "in" or "at" in English.
Their uses are mutually exclusive.
"Ni", when used to show location, is used only with stative verbs such as "iru", "to be, exist;" "aru", "to be, exist, have;" and "sumu", "to live, inhabit."
"De" is used with action verbs to convey the place of action, as opposed to location of being.
========,3,に "ni" and へ "e".
"Ni" and "e" can both indicate direction of motion, meaning "to" or "at" in English.
In this sense, "e" is perhaps closer to English "towards" in terms of use (see example below).
As long as "ni" is used directionally, it is possible to substitute "e" in its place.
"Ni" used in other senses cannot be replaced by "e":
Indicating direction, using "e" instead of "ni" is preferred when "ni" is used non-directionally in proximity:
========,3,が "ga" and を "o".
In some cases, "ga" and "o" are interchangeable.
For example, with the "tai" form, meaning "want to", it is possible to say either of the following:
Similarly, 好き "suki", a "na adjective" meaning "liked", can take either "ga" or "o":
========,3,に "ni" and と "to".
"Ni" and "to" are sometimes interchangeable in forms like になる "ni naru" and となる "to naru".
The "ni naru" form suggests a natural change, whereas "to naru" suggests change to a final stage.
========,3,Historical Particles.
い "i" was used in Old Japanese and kanbun works.
Its meaning is still debated, but has traditionally been considered emphatic.
========,2,Differences from English prepositions.
Many Japanese particles fill the role of prepositions in English, but they are unlike prepositions in many ways.
Japanese does not have equivalents of prepositions like "on", and often uses particles along with verbs and nouns to modify another word where English might use prepositions.
For example, "ue" is a noun meaning "top/up"; and "ni tsuite" is a fixed verbal expression meaning "concerning", and when used as postpositions:
