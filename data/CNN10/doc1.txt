We`re bringing you up to speed right now on the U.S. Senate`s impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump. First, it`s over. On Saturday, the former leader was found not guilty of the charge of incitement of insurrection. The House of Representatives brought that charge after a riot occurred at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th.
Then President Trump had spoken to supporters at a massive rally earlier that day. His accusers say his word encouraged some of the people there to
violently protest at the Capitol Building afterward. His defenders said he only encouraged a peaceful protest and wasn`t responsible for the riot. After the House impeaches or formally charges a president with a crime, the Senate decides whether to convict or acquit the leader. That chamber`s proceedings wrapped up quickly late last week ahead of the Valentines and Presidents Day holidays. Fifty-seven Senators voted to find former President Trump guilty of the House charge. That included all 50 of the Senate`s Democrats plus seven Republicans. Forty-three Senators, all Republicans voted to find former President Trump not guilty. For a leader to be convicted, the Constitution says that 2/3 of the Senate or 67 members must find the president guilty. The final count was 10 votes short of that so former President Trump was acquitted. One of the Republican Senators who voted against him said that former President Trump was responsible for inciting the violence at the Capitol and that the charge rose the level of quote "high crimes and misdemeanors". That`s the phrase the Constitution uses as a reason to impeach a president. Former President Trump`s attorney says his client was vindicated and that quote "the political witch-hunt that the Democrats had thrown at him was defeated". President Trump is the first American leader to be impeached twice by the House and acquitted twice by the Senate. He and the Trump organization are still the subjects of various legal investigations outside the Federal government.

As one American political storm comes to an end, an American winter storm is icily raking its way across the country. Here`s CNN 10 Contributor Tyler Mauldin. We have this Artic air plunging down across the Plains and if it`s not below freezing, below zero where you live, it certainly feels like it`s below zero. We have wind chill warnings in effect from Canada all the way to Texas for the first time in history, Houston, Texas is under a wind chill warning. Temperatures are about 50 degrees below average for your Monday. That`s going to last right on into Tuesday and are we going to see records broken? Yes. Absolutely. Over the next 48 hours, we have the potential of seeing 250 cold record temperatures, or cold temperature records rather. We also have the snow too and the ice as well. You can see that hear. In fact, down in southeast Texas, we`re dealing with not just thunder snow but thunder ice in Houston, Texas and this is going to be moving to the northeast. And that is the reason why we have winter storm warnings from the southern Plains all the way to New England as this low pressure system ejects to the northeast. It`s going to bring heavy snow. It`s going to bring that cold air with it and it`s also going to bring the threat for ice and it`s really the ice that`s going to be problematic for us over the next few days.

Some hopeful news concerning coronavirus in America. The number of new daily cases continues to decrease. This chart tracks the number of positive tests recorded in the U.S. since last March and the total number of deaths since then in which COVID-19 was blamed as a factor. Since early January, the numbers have steadily dropped and officials say it`s not just because of vaccinations. As only about 4 percent of the population has received both vaccine doses. Two major reasons they say new cases are declining. One, people are reportedly doing a better job of wearing masks and keeping their distance from one another. And two, doctors think there`ve been so many infections in some places that people have developed natural immunities to the virus. New variants or mutations of COVID-19 could still cause new infections and it`s still unknown where and how the virus originated. The leader of the WHO mission to China investigating the origins of the coronavirus has told CNN the virus was likely much wider spread in China in December 2019 than was thought. (Inaudible) revealed the 174 positive cases found that first December, likely severe cases, meant they could actually been an estimated 1,000-plus total cases in and around the city of Wuhan that month. The virus was (inaudible) Wuhan in December which, I think, is a -- is a new -- is a new finding and the 100 that was confirmed and the 74 clinically -- About 174 would suggest 1,000 or so plus even? Yes. Probably. (inaudible) because that`s, again, (inaudible). The team also established that in that first December, there were as many as 13 slight variations of the virus from samples of all or bits of its genetic code circulating in and around Wuhan where this seafood market is thought to have played a role. We have 13 strains covering -- covering individuals in December. Some of them from the markets or in the markets. Some of them not linked to the markets. This is something we found as part of our mission. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That many variations so early on could suggest the virus had been circulating for some time some analysts told CNN, although precise timing is still unclear. There work, heavily scrutinized, tense and frustrating conditions.

10 Second Trivia. From what country did Iceland achieve its independence in 1944? Greenland, Norway, Germany or Denmark. In 1944, Iceland achieved its independence from Denmark while that country was occupied by Germany. Tourism is a major industry in Iceland. It`s one of the main reasons why its economy was charting steady growth before the coronavirus pandemic spread around the world last year. The winter nights are long in this European country but that and its position in the north Atlantic can give visitors a spectacular view of the Northern Lights. They`re often visible from September through March. There are some travel restrictions in place there from COVID testing to a mandatory quarantine but we can take you on a virtual trip to Iceland right now. Here`s CNN Contributor Chris James. Hey Carl, as you know, I live in New York City and because of the city`s bright lights. Very often it`s hard for me to look up in the sky at night and see stars. But for today`s virtual field trip, I want to take you to a location where the sky is lit up with incredible colors at night. Not by artificial sources like here in New York, but instead by mother nature herself. Welcome to the country of Iceland. This is one of the best places on planet Earth to check out the aurora borealis, better known to most people as the Northern Lights. I don`t think there are many other natural spectacles in the world that can match up to the magnificence of the Northern Lights. Seeing this up close and personal has been called quote, "a pinnacle life experience" for the people that are lucky enough to check it out. And right now, we are in the window of peak viewing time for people to see the Northern Lights in Iceland which runs from the month of October to March. There are actually forecasts online that predict the best visibility for the lights on the Icelandic National Weather website. When the forecast is strong, all you have to do is drive or take a bus to dark area and look up. The phenomenon is caused by solar winds which push electronic particles to collide with molecules of atmospheric acids that cause an emission of bright light. Green, blue and even red colors can be seen. One of the best spots to check out this natural light show is at the Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon on the southeast coast of Iceland, about 250 kilometers from Reykjavik. The iceberg filled lagoon manages to reflect the lights in an incredibly beautiful way. Look at this, making for the perfect spot to sit back and watch this breathtaking force of nature. If you happen to go, make sure you check out the forecast. The lights are brightest on a clear and cold night.

For 10 out of 10, is it possible to spend $5 million caring for a dog? One woman is about to find out. This is Lulu (ph). She`s an eight- year-old Border Collie who`s owner recently died. He left a family friend in charge of the dog and his will set aside a sum of $5 million to help care for LuLu (ph). The animal`s new caretaker says she doesn`t really know what to make of all this but that she`s willing to try to spend the money for LuLu (ph). Well, the money has gone to the "dawg". And we don`t know what LuLu`s (ph) going to do when she gets her "paws" on all that. Maybe here dreams "border" on "collaring" her own sheep to herd. Maybe she`s ready to trade the "ruff" life to "embark" on something new. One thing you can make no "bones" about that inheritance has just made LuLu (ph) a "slum dog" millionaire.
