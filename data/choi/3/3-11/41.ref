The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . 
An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . 
There are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . 
For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . 
For the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . 
The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 .

Sentiment . 
Tension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . 
One of the devices for tension management is preferential mating . 
The preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study . 
The relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating . 
It would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society . 
The supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation . 
The newlyweds building homes on the same land with either set of parents , and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive relationship .

Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . 
The disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . 
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . 
Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . 
Fears prejudicial aspects `` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , Bellows told the court .

Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . 
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . 
Siebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . 
Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . 
A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . 
House throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . 
Catcher Frank House 's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . 
Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run . 
Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A 's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani 's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair 's glove into center . 
The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers . 
Three were doubles , Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one .

Fears prejudicial aspects `` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , Bellows told the court . 
`` Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . 
It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others '' . 
Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , `` You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this '' ? ?

the honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor . 
Occasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all . 
They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . 
I must add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . 
It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather . 
Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease .

Enrique Jorda , conductor and musical director of the San Francisco Symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony 's Golden Anniversary season , it was announced . 
The guest assignments are scheduled for November 14 and 18 , with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne . 
The season in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22 . 
During his five-month visit abroad , Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique De Bordeau in France , and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome . 
In announcing Jorda 's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on Wednesday . 
Guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists Yehudi Menuhin , Isaac Stern , Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel ; ; pianists Leon Fleisher , Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray . 
The Leningrad Kirov Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House , is , I think , the finest `` classical '' ballet company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky `` Sleeping Beauty '' with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing . 
This work is no favorite of mine . 
I am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect ; ; that its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was ; ; that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people ; ; that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms . 
All of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the Kirov 's utterly captivating presentation .

A gyro-stabilized platform system , using restrained gyros , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination . 
The restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , neglecting transient effects , as follows : Afj where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro . 
The platform angle \*\* yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling . 
This is normally termed the gyro input axis , 90-degrees away from the gyro output or \*\* yj axis . 
The gyro angular momentum is defined by H . 
Thus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the \*\* yf axis , the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Afj if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Afj . 
It is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes .
