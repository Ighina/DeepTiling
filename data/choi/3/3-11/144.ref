An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . 
First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . 
Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . 
All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . 
The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . 
Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . 
However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances .

Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel 's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor '' . 
J.H. Miller 's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . 
In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . 
This essay seeks to make that exploration . 
Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . 
He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor 's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response .

Temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - 90-degrees-F ( 29 - 32-degrees-C ) . 
The top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs .. Sixty lbs. loading is possible but 40 lbs. is adequate . 
The suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe ( thus returning suds to soap box ) and the machine is started . 
The 160-ml. bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen . 
Washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls . 
At the conclusion of the washing , 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-F ( 32 \* 0C. ) are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs , 4 liters to each tub . 
This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes . 
During the rinsing operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow from the main drain begins . 
At this point the drains are readjusted so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the 2-12 mark on the drain gauge . 
When all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs . 
The run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line .

The Summary Report On Desegregation Progress In Education In The Middle-South Region , 1959 - 1960 '' clearly shows two pieces of information . 
The Summary Report , which was prepared for this Conference , indicates , first , that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing ; ; second , that both actual and pending desegregation is , with few exceptions , the product or result of court order . 
The Report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow . 
The Middle-South Region , as defined by the National Association of Intergroup Relations Officials ( NAIRO ) , consists of the states of Kentucky , Maryland , Tennessee , West Virginia , Delaware , Virginia and the District of Columbia . 
The states and the Nation 's Capital all have some desegregation , in fact some dating back to 1954 ; ; but the region also embraces some of the staunchest opposition . 
Desegregation has been opposed by massive resistance , interposition , pupil assignment ( with no assignments of Negro children ) , and hate bombings . 
Desegregation and court order Now let 's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order . 
First Kentucky . 
Elementary school desegregation came to Owen and Union Counties , which already had high school desegregation . 
The action was a result of a court order , the citation for which ( and for other court action mentioned in this paper ) is taken from the Summary Report for this Conference .

There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . 
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . 
The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . 
( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . 
) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison .

the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . 
Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm 's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . 
To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . 
In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . 
These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . 
The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . 
The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . 
It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . 
Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas .

It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels . 
No single explanation is adequate to account for this . 
Improvement , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed . 
The first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses .

a few years , foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral , and important , phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight . 
Urethane foam , as only one example , was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955 . 
Yet last year 's volume probably topped 100 million lb. and expectations are for a market of 275 million lb. by 1964 . 
Many of the other foamed plastics , particularly the styrenes , show similar growth potential . 
And there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated . 
As this issue goes to press , for example , one manufacturer has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength ; ; another reports that a cellular polypropylene , primarily for use in wire coating applications , is being investigated .

the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies , they wo n't be misled by the Pirates ' slower start this season . 
`` Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat '' , Mauch said here the other day . 
`` The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year . 
They have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby Shantz '' . 
Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball 's world champions . 
The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9 . 
Change in pitchers . 
Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio , for several reasons : 1 Broglio 's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; ; 2 The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible ; ; 3 The Redbirds ' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday .

The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc . 
. 
A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian . 
For English the reduction in size is less striking . 
This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word . 
The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file . 
Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis .
