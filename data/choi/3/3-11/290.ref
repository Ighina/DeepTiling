The following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record synchronizers , inquiry synchronizers , and alteration switches . 
The declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 ) . 
Continuation cards Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder coding sheet . 
When this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that `` Continuation Cards '' may be used . 
Thus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow . 
The label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ; i.e. , it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet . 
The operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation cards but may end with the comma following any parameter .

one characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . 
Much of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky 's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . 
In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages . 
Through long experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself . 
Giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words . 
The moments of sung melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and liturgical chants . 
Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- Boris ' first monologue , for example . 
Even then , the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance .

Introduction . 
In 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . 
These are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . 
Then in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . 
No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible . 
1 . 
Let Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli Afj and Afj , and let \*\* zg be a Afj curve of order K on Q .

this evidence in mind , the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes . 
Toward the end of the semester 's work , he interviewed every married class member at great length . 
He found , as he had suspected , a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students . 
However , all admitted that the `` hindsight '' was not altogether lost . 
In their own words , it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time . 
In fact , they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be , at the beginning , some `` hindsight '' study ; ; but they all hastened to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent . 
All of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course . 
A few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students .

Analysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . 
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . 
Impersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . 
Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals .

An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . 
First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . 
Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . 
All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . 
The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting .

one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? 
These items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . 
There does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . 
With respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . 
To this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . 
It is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor 's tax attributes . 
Such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code . 
Refund claims Section 203 of the United States Code voids an assignment of a claim against the Government unless made after it has been allowed , the amount due has been ascertained , and a warrant for its payment has been issued .

artists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . 
To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . 
At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . 
Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . 
And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . 
The storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men 's minds .

Oslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . 
This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . 
In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems . 
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . 
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . 
Explosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . 
The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . 
There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . 
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive . 
Even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line .

A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . 
But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . 
The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . 
By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . 
This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . 
Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold 's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking .
