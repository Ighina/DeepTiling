Asilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . 
`` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play '' , he commented . 
Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . 
`` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop '' , he said . 
The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . 
There have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . 
`` The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries '' , Buchheister told the delegates .

Analysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . 
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . 
Impersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . 
Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals .

Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . 
Laurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter 's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults . 
Felix Kopstein states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length '' , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity .

Control of socioeconomic status It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching method . 
The structured schools were in an industrial city , with three-family tenement houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes . 
The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle - to upper-middle class , but fringed by an industrial area . 
In order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods . 
School principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas . 
An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data .

A cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $ 25,000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off Tuesday . 
Mrs. Alice H. Reese , wife of an engineer and mother of a 23-year-old son , was awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel . 
Mrs. Reese entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals . 
Second grand prize of $ 5,000 went to Mrs. Clara L. Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring , a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze . 
Mother of five Mrs. Oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist . 
She lives in Wellsville , Mo .. Mrs. Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals . 
And the third time was the charm .

Two metabolites ( 1 , and 2 ) ) of p-aminobenzoic acid ( PABA ) which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast bacteria are biosynthesized from Afj . 
The 7 carbons of PABA are incorporated directly into metabolite 2 ( ( as shown with both ring-labeled and carboxy-labeled Afj ) . 
Thirty-five of the 36 carbon atoms arise from Afj . 
All 28 carbons of metabolite 1 ( ( a product of mild acid hydrolysis of 2 ) arise from Afj .

2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . 
In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . 
With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . 
Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . 
Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . 
If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . 
There are several closely related inner functions . 
In the last analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man 's deepest experience -- the religious .

6.4 . 
The primary decomposition theorem We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary . 
We can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1 . 
What can we do with the general T ? ? 
If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . 
First , T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed .

The nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . 
Afterward , Tennessee 's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . 
What Herter presented , said Gore , was `` not a very encouraging review '' . 
That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . 
While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . 
1 ) Cuba . 
Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . 
President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . 
`` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure '' , said the President . 
`` That limit has now been reached '' . 
Through Secretary Herter , Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision .

the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . 
For many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . 
It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . 
Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . 
In fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . 
Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . 
A measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began . 
The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $ 12.50 a share . 
The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler , Guerin & Turner , the managing underwriter , was at $ 17 a share . 
And from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $ 22 a share . 
But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market .
