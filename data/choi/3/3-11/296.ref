Biological warfare Biological warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man . 
It is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems . 
Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals . 
Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon . 
The major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect . 
The incubation period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter . 
A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases . 
Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities .

Temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - 90-degrees-F ( 29 - 32-degrees-C ) . 
The top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs .. Sixty lbs. loading is possible but 40 lbs. is adequate . 
The suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe ( thus returning suds to soap box ) and the machine is started . 
The 160-ml. bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen . 
Washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls . 
At the conclusion of the washing , 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-F ( 32 \* 0C. ) are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs , 4 liters to each tub . 
This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes . 
During the rinsing operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow from the main drain begins . 
At this point the drains are readjusted so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the 2-12 mark on the drain gauge .

Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . 
Some vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . 
Current programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . 
Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . 
The George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . 
The Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . 
The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . 
Annual authorizations of $ 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians . 
The Federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools .

the outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity . 
By and large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates . 
Moreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates . 
Nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity . 
During much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau , but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy .

Anglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age . 
Hrothgar 's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf 's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous ' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . 
Nothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . 
Since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . 
That such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny . 
Milman Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived ; ; he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas . 
Proceeding from Parry 's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata , Francis P. Magoun , Jr. , argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations , and the thesis is striking and compelling .

the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . 
B. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . 
However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . 
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . 
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . 
In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . 
If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . 
It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . 
On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Afj and then to Afj as the active iodinating species .

invisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency . 
`` Disaffiliation '' , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , Lawrence Lipton , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as Epigraph : `` We disaffiliate . 
'' -- John L. Lewis . 
Like the pillars of Hercules , like two ruined Titans guarding the entrance to one of Dante 's circles , stand two great dead juvenile delinquents -- the heroes of the post-war generation : the great saxophonist , Charlie Parker , and Dylan Thomas . 
If the word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves . 
Both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art . 
Both of them were my friends . 
Living in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue . 
So as the years passed , I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration . 
The last time I saw Bird , at Jimbo 's Bob City , he was so gone -- so blind to the world -- that he literally sat down on me before he realized I was there .

Examples of binomial experiments Some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent trials , each with two possible outcomes . 
The binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another . 
We devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that recur in many other probability models . 
We begin with a few examples of binomial experiments . 
Marksmanship example . 
A trained marksman shooting five rounds at a target , all under practically the same conditions , may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times . 
In repeated sets of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary . 
What can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes ? ?

it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` structuring '' experience . 
It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like '' as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . 
This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . 
Responses such as `` rope with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of rope '' , were quite characteristic . 
Guilford-Martin personality inventories . 
The three personality inventories ( Guilford ; ; Guilford-Martin ; ; Guilford-Martin ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects . 
These were the same subjects who were given the Rorschach test . 
Some predictions had been made concerning factors R , N , I and Co on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity . 
Only Co differentiated between the two groups at less than the 5 % level ( Afj ) .

Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . 
Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . 
Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . 
Three weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . 
Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . 
Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . 
Both Cook 's and Russell 's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion . 
General manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished . 
On February 17 , Russell and Cook were sent to the Pena Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting out ranches the company had purchased . 
While talking with Julian M. Beall , Francisco Archuleta and Juan Marcus appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for a while , rode away . 
It was nearly sundown before they finished the business with Beall and began riding down the stream .
