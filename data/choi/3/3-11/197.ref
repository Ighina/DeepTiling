6.4 . 
The primary decomposition theorem We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary . 
We can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1 . 
What can we do with the general T ? ? 
If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . 
First , T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed .

last the White House is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master American craftsman , Duncan Phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U.S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings . 
The American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion 's library . 
The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800 's . 
The gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey , whose famous estate , `` Tranquility '' , was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover , N. J .. Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago . 
This acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs . 
The AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy 's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home . 
It is the AID 's intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of Americana '' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall .

Analysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . 
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . 
Impersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . 
Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . 
For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . 
Examples Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . 
One should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas . 
Evaluation The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . 
Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive -- and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high .

the honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor . 
Occasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all . 
They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . 
I must add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . 
It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather . 
Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . 
The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind .

the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . 
Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm 's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . 
To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . 
In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . 
These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface .

Introduction . 
In 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . 
These are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . 
Then in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . 
No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible . 
1 . 
Let Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli Afj and Afj , and let \*\* zg be a Afj curve of order K on Q . 
A general line L meets Q in two points , Afj and Afj , through each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus , Afj , whose lines are simple secants of Afj . 
On these generators let Afj and Afj be , respectively , the harmonic conjugates of Afj and Afj with respect to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets Afj .

There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . 
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . 
The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . 
( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . 
) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison .

A cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $ 25,000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off Tuesday . 
Mrs. Alice H. Reese , wife of an engineer and mother of a 23-year-old son , was awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel . 
Mrs. Reese entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals . 
Second grand prize of $ 5,000 went to Mrs. Clara L. Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring , a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze . 
Mother of five Mrs. Oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist . 
She lives in Wellsville , Mo .. Mrs. Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals . 
And the third time was the charm . 
She dreamed up the cookie recipe , tried it , liked it and entered it in the contest . 
The second baking was for photographing when told she was a finalist .

Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . 
Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . 
Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian .
