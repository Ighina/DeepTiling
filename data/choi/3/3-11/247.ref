Martin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them . 
After they have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects ; ; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely . 
The ability to think seems to increase consistently with age . 
One experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years .

Many studies indicate that elementary-school children 's interests cover the whole field of science ; ; that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events ; ; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden . 
Emotional characteristics How a child feels about himself , about other people , and about the tasks confronting him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics . 
A considerable amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not likely to do well in school subjects . 
Emotional maturity is the result of many factors , the principal ones being the experiences of the first few years of the child 's life .

the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband 's marginal income , her defense of denial was excessively strong . 
Thus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem . 
The result , dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family 's disrupted daily functioning , was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin , whose birth had not been anticipated . 
Soon Mrs. B. 's fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family . 
Inability to care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the babies , who seemed colicky , bone-weary fatigue , repeated crying episodes , and short tempers reflected the family 's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation . 
Clearly , this was a family in crisis . 
Mrs. B. compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of her mother 's death when she was eight , as well as her subsequent anger at her father for remarrying .

Analysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . 
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . 
Impersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . 
Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . 
For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . 
Examples Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . 
One should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas .

Organization : In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances . 
T.V. Barker , who developed the classification-angle system , was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931 . 
The compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University Museum at Oxford . 
Since 1948 the working headquarters has been the Department of Geology and Mineralogy . 
Numerous cooperating individuals in Great Britain , Holland , the United States , and Belgium have contributed editorially or by making calculations . 
Great interest and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee . 
Financial and material help have come from academic , governmental , and industrial organizations in England and Holland . 
Editors for Volumes 1 , and 2 , were M.W. Porter and the late R.C. Spiller , both of Oxford University .

toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . 
Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . 
Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . 
Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . 
Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . 
Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing .

Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . 
The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . 
The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . 
These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . 
In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . 
A well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio .

The thermal exchange of chlorine between Afj and liquid Afj is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180-degrees and above . 
The photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65-degrees using light absorbed only by the Afj . 
In the gas phase , with Afj of Afj and Afj of Afj , quantum yields of the order of Afj have been observed at 85-degrees . 
Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction . 
It appears possible to set a lower limit of about Afj for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form Afj radical . 
The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions . 
Introduction Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data . 
It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals , as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen bond .

the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . 
B. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . 
However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . 
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . 
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . 
In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine .

High-gain , photoelectronic image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicability . 
Examples of such situations are ( aerial ) night reconnaissance , the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues , special radiography in medical or industrial applications , track recording of high energy particles , etc .. High-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods ; ; some of these are listed below : ( A ) Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B ) Channel-type , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C ) Image intensifier based upon the `` multipactor '' principle , ( D ) Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers ( TSEM tubes ) , ( E ) Cascading of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope . 
Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely . 
Channel-type image intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values ; ; they suffer , however , from an inherently low resolution . 
Image intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned . 
However , the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain .

reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . 
And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . 
One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . 
Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . 
Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . 
The double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . 
For more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . 
By all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution . 
The first , or double-step , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of its application to railroads ( and other transportation agencies ) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission . 
The Cost Section distinguishes between ( directly ) variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter .
