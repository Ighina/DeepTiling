briefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences . 
Then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance . 
And then the application of the count rules to the width ( horizontally ) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline . 
The very idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement . 
This expectation is what really `` sold '' point and figure . 
But there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense . 
Experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply , and in fine , these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations and intensities of events . 
After all , too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long . 
The advantages and disadvantages of these two types of charting , bar charting and point and figure charting , remain the subject of fairly good-natured litigation among their respective professional advocates , with both methods enjoying in common , one irrevocable merit .

The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc . 
. 
A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian . 
For English the reduction in size is less striking . 
This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word . 
The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file . 
Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis . 
We suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem . 
But first , we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood : form -- any unique sequence of alphabetic characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space ; ; occurrence -- an instance of a form in text . 
We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text .

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . 
The current monthly payroll comes to about $ 15,000,000 . 
Howard E. Simpson , the railroad 's president , said , `` A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action '' . 
The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . 
Salary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . 
There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . 
2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . 
Since the railroad can not reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman said . 
Those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages . 
The spokesman said the number to be furloughed can not be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job .

Analysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . 
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . 
Impersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . 
Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . 
For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . 
Examples Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . 
One should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas . 
Evaluation The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . 
Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive -- and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high . 
It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired -- and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed .

Asilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . 
`` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play '' , he commented . 
Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . 
`` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop '' , he said . 
The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . 
There have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . 
`` The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries '' , Buchheister told the delegates . 
In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including Point Reyes ; ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; ; stronger water pollution control programs , and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil .

Mr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power . 
In this view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the generality of Article 1 . 
If this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction . 
Federal question jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law . 
Then in 1875 , apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the Civil War , Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- concurrently with state tribunals -- to decide cases involving federal-right questions . 
One purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference . 
Serious difficulty arose with the advent of Substantive Due Process . 
An amendment , presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves , became a `` laissez-faire '' limitation upon state economic policy .

London , Feb. 9 -- Vital secrets of Britain 's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy 's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . 
The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . 
It is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . 
It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy 's Nautilus , the world 's first atomic submarine . 
Its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . 
Five held for trial The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . 
A full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . 
They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard .

Oslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . 
This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . 
In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems . 
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . 
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . 
Explosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . 
The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . 
There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . 
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive . 
Even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line .

Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I 'm sorry , but we do n't have that book . 
There would n't be much demand for it , I 'm afraid '' . 
Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest .

The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . 
An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . 
There are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . 
For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream .
