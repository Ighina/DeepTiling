the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . 
B. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . 
However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . 
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . 
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . 
In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . 
If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . 
It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . 
On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Afj and then to Afj as the active iodinating species .

Austin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel 's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . 
Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . 
Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . 
But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . 
Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 .

Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . 
The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . 
The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . 
These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . 
In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . 
A well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio . 
Hard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork . 
The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders .

Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I 'm sorry , but we do n't have that book . 
There would n't be much demand for it , I 'm afraid '' . 
Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . 
What to buy out of the year 's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? 
What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? 
Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . 
A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $ 500 annually , which includes the librarian 's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world 's richest city . 
The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse .

The vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world . 
During the summer of 1960 , it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle . 
The contestants in this economic struggle are the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee ( AWOC ) of the AFL-CIO and the agricultural employers of the State . 
By virtue of the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces . 
It is not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have endeavored to maintain . 
We have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose . 
Inevitably , one side was pleased and the other displeased , regardless of how we ruled . 
Often the displeased parties interpreted our decision as implying favoritism toward the other . 
We have consoled ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding .

Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel 's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor '' . 
J.H. Miller 's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . 
In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . 
This essay seeks to make that exploration .

it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible . 
The instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating . 
The force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal .

one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? 
These items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . 
There does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . 
With respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . 
To this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . 
It is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor 's tax attributes .

Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . 
Laurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter 's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults . 
Felix Kopstein states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length '' , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity . 
It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . 
Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions . 
Additional records of slow growth have been omitted . 
It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves . 
There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda ) . 
Data on the former are scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length .

Examples of binomial experiments Some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent trials , each with two possible outcomes . 
The binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another . 
We devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that recur in many other probability models . 
We begin with a few examples of binomial experiments . 
Marksmanship example . 
A trained marksman shooting five rounds at a target , all under practically the same conditions , may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times . 
In repeated sets of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary . 
What can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes ? ?
