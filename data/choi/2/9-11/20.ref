Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . 
Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . 
Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . 
Three weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . 
Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . 
Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . 
Both Cook 's and Russell 's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion . 
General manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished . 
On February 17 , Russell and Cook were sent to the Pena Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting out ranches the company had purchased . 
While talking with Julian M. Beall , Francisco Archuleta and Juan Marcus appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for a while , rode away .

The nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . 
Afterward , Tennessee 's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . 
What Herter presented , said Gore , was `` not a very encouraging review '' . 
That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . 
While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . 
1 ) Cuba . 
Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . 
President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . 
`` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure '' , said the President . 
`` That limit has now been reached '' .

East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes . 
Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally '' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . 
East Providence now has no civil defense program . 
Mr. Hawksley , the state 's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years . 
He is not interested in being named a full-time director . 
Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation 's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . 
He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $ 3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs . 
Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job . 
One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin , he said . 
Along with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized .

the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . 
B. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . 
However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . 
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . 
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . 
In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . 
If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . 
It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . 
On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Afj and then to Afj as the active iodinating species . 
In the thyroid gland it appears that proteins ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated .

Plainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism '' . 
Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr . 
R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . 
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . 
It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women 's Clubs . 
Hughes said Monday , `` It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . 
Now he 's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state '' . 
Sunday he had added , `` We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership '' . 
Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign . 
`` How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this '' ? ? 
He asked .

The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . 
Gary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . 
Arnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . 
`` Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . 
And that is just what happened on the last few holes . 
The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . 
Player was the first to feel its teeth . 
After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday 's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player 's game rapidly fell to pieces . 
He bogeyed the 10th . 
After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th . 
He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 .

The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . 
An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . 
There are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . 
For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . 
For the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . 
The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 . 
The essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman . 
He recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process , the remaining stages must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process . 
Moreover , by systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal Af-stage policy for the remaining stages , we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all R stages .
