Elburn , Ill . 
-- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales : `` We 've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more . 
We sold only four pickers all last year '' . 
Gus Ehlers , competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community , says his business since August 1 is running 50 % above a year earlier . 
`` Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20 % '' , he says . 
Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas . 
Paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output . 
Although the Administration 's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines . 
Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment can not handle them efficiently .

St. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . 
-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . 
Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion . 
He returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . 
Stepson vindicated The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman 's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . 
Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . 
Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . 
When the verdict came in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said : `` I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed . 
Still , I do n't wish to appear happy at somebody else 's misfortune '' . 
Lives on welfare Hengesbach , who has been living on welfare recently , said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia , 27 miles southwest of here .

It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels . 
No single explanation is adequate to account for this . 
Improvement , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed . 
The first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses . 
Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . 
An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types . 
By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour languages . 
This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone . 
Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist . 
Papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work . 
The second need is better field techniques .

the outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity . 
By and large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates . 
Moreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates . 
Nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity . 
During much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau , but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy . 
The tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident . 
Although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest , it is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer . 
It is difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust . 
The rate of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some decline .

A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . 
It consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . 
There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . 
A tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . 
In normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . 
After it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . 
By the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained . 
The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described . 
In this test a Afj tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of Afj with a clearance of 0.002 '' '' on each side of the tape .

reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . 
And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . 
One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . 
Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . 
Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . 
The double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . 
For more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . 
By all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution . 
The first , or double-step , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of its application to railroads ( and other transportation agencies ) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission . 
The Cost Section distinguishes between ( directly ) variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter . 
The variable costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing `` long-run out-of-pocket costs '' -- a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the economist 's `` long-run marginal costs '' .

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . 
The current monthly payroll comes to about $ 15,000,000 . 
Howard E. Simpson , the railroad 's president , said , `` A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action '' . 
The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . 
Salary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . 
There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . 
2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . 
Since the railroad can not reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman said . 
Those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages . 
The spokesman said the number to be furloughed can not be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job . 
A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $ 18 at Franklin and Mount Streets .

Salem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month 's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . 
It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . 
William Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . 
At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . 
But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . 
No request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . 
Board oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year 's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . 
The contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $ 8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . 
Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes .

briefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences . 
Then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance . 
And then the application of the count rules to the width ( horizontally ) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline . 
The very idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement . 
This expectation is what really `` sold '' point and figure . 
But there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense . 
Experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply , and in fine , these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations and intensities of events . 
After all , too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long . 
The advantages and disadvantages of these two types of charting , bar charting and point and figure charting , remain the subject of fairly good-natured litigation among their respective professional advocates , with both methods enjoying in common , one irrevocable merit . 
They are both trend-following methods . 
Even if we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum , the `` odds '' still favor them both , for the trend in effect is always more likely to continue than to reverse .

Washington on President-elect John F. Kennedy 's Convair , the Caroline , winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal , Cinemactor Peter Lawford , Jack Kennedy 's brother-in-law . 
Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital 's National Guard Armory . 
Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival : `` It 's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia . 
I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans '' ! ! 
As the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory 's $ 100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $ 10,000 each . 
The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper , who regularly makes up ladies ' ensembles . 
Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered `` two of everything '' just `` in case he spills anything '' , Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing . 
A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps , General David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless New Year '' greeting to his Pentagon staff . 
Said Leatherneck Shoup : `` A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands . 
After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on . 
Little geeing and hawing have been necessary '' .
