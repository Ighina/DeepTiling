Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention '' . 
With respect to this view , two points are worth making . 
First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' . 
It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' . 
It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in More 's lexicon , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn .

sentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . 
The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . 
There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . 
Thus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley 's hymns are as follows . 
`` A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify '' . 
In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . 
Dominant stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last .

The thermal exchange of chlorine between Afj and liquid Afj is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180-degrees and above . 
The photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65-degrees using light absorbed only by the Afj . 
In the gas phase , with Afj of Afj and Afj of Afj , quantum yields of the order of Afj have been observed at 85-degrees . 
Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction .

toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . 
Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . 
Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . 
Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . 
Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . 
Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing .

one characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . 
Much of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky 's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . 
In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages . 
Through long experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself . 
Giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words . 
The moments of sung melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and liturgical chants . 
Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- Boris ' first monologue , for example . 
Even then , the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance . 
Aside from Boris himself , one need but examine the secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among the masters of musical portraiture . 
Even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities , defined with economical precision . 
Consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action : Pimen , Varlaam , Missail and the Jesuit Rangoni .

this evidence in mind , the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes . 
Toward the end of the semester 's work , he interviewed every married class member at great length . 
He found , as he had suspected , a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students . 
However , all admitted that the `` hindsight '' was not altogether lost .

Santa Barbara -- `` The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn '' , Beryl W. Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conference . 
Another speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more '' . 
He urged support for President Kennedy 's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . 
' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan '' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . 
`` In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial '' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 '' . 
Thesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence '' . 
Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth '' , he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery '' . 
Danger cited He cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation '' . 
The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 '' .

the statement empirical , for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard . 
What were they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value ? ? 
To find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery . 
It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only . 
If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like `` Hurrah '' or `` Fiddlesticks '' , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest . 
This is the course the positivists took . 
They explained value judgments by explaining them away . 
Now I do not think their view will do .

The Sane Society is an ambitious work . 
Its scope is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society ? ? 
A work so broad , even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision , must necessarily `` fail '' . 
Even a hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots , errors of fact and argument , important exclusions , areas of ignorance and prejudice , undue emphases on trivia , examples of broad positions supported by flimsy evidence , and the like . 
Such books are easy prey for critics . 
Nor need the critic be captious . 
A careful and orderly man , who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility , might easily be put off by such a book .
