the Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . 
The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . 
Research at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg with loadings from 8 to 120 lb . 
Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . 
Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . 
Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen hr .

O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes . 
They indicated that a 4-day retention , aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 per cent BOD reduction .

Greer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . 
As a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . 
She will receive the 1961 `` Oscar '' at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . 
The only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women 's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men 's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . 
The silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center .

Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . 
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . 
Siebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . 
Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . 
A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . 
House throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . 
Catcher Frank House 's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . 
Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run .

The primary decomposition theorem We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary . 
We can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1 . 
What can we do with the general T ? ? 
If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . 
First , T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed .

Austin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel 's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . 
Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . 
Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . 
But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . 
Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . 
He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic '' . 
It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . 
The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . 
The escheat law can not be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . 
Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers .

Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . 
First , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . 
In contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls .

Austin , Texas -- A Texas halfback who does n't even know the team 's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games . 
Time stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field . 
Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of football .

Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . 
The disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . 
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . 
Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . 
Fears prejudicial aspects `` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , Bellows told the court . 
`` Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property .

The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc . 
. 
A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian . 
For English the reduction in size is less striking . 
This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word .

A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . 
But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . 
The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . 
By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa .
