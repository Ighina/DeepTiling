the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies , they wo n't be misled by the Pirates ' slower start this season . 
`` Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat '' , Mauch said here the other day . 
`` The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year . 
They have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby Shantz '' . 
Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball 's world champions . 
The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9 .

The following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record synchronizers , inquiry synchronizers , and alteration switches . 
The declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 ) . 
Continuation cards Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder coding sheet . 
When this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that `` Continuation Cards '' may be used . 
Thus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow . 
The label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ; i.e. , it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet . 
The operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation cards but may end with the comma following any parameter . 
Remarks may appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces . 
Illustrations of the use of continuation cards are included throughout the examples illustrating the various statements . 
If a continuation card follows a statement that does not permit continuation cards , the compiler will generate a NOP and issue an error message .

Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . 
The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . 
The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . 
These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . 
In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . 
A well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio . 
Hard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork . 
The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders . 
In addition , many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products .

Mr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power . 
In this view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the generality of Article 1 . 
If this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction . 
Federal question jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law . 
Then in 1875 , apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the Civil War , Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- concurrently with state tribunals -- to decide cases involving federal-right questions . 
One purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference . 
Serious difficulty arose with the advent of Substantive Due Process . 
An amendment , presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves , became a `` laissez-faire '' limitation upon state economic policy . 
A flood of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of local government . 
Congress reacted with a series of measures modifying in various ways what it had granted in 1875 .

These societies can expect to face difficult times . 
As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction . 
National leaders will have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men 's sense of identity .

2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . 
In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . 
With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . 
Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . 
Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . 
If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . 
There are several closely related inner functions . 
In the last analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man 's deepest experience -- the religious . 
Man is first religious ; ; the instrumentalities follow .

Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I 'm sorry , but we do n't have that book . 
There would n't be much demand for it , I 'm afraid '' . 
Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . 
What to buy out of the year 's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? 
What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ?

individual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration , fermentation , salting , chemical treatment , canning , refrigeration , and freezing . 
The basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter , to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects , and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of harvest or production to areas of consumption . 
In earlier years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival .

Examples of binomial experiments Some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent trials , each with two possible outcomes . 
The binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another . 
We devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that recur in many other probability models . 
We begin with a few examples of binomial experiments . 
Marksmanship example . 
A trained marksman shooting five rounds at a target , all under practically the same conditions , may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times .
