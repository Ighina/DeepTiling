Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5-3 . 
The husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . 
It was Nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight . 
They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack . 
Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning . 
He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw .

Abstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . 
Thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . 
It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . 
A detailed energy balance of the anode was established . 
The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . 
The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Afj . 
Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities .

Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . 
Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . 
Or , in the words of Anatole France , `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges '' . 
The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan 's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . 
The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . 
In addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . 
It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . 
Business Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating .

2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . 
In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . 
With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . 
Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . 
Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . 
If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . 
There are several closely related inner functions . 
In the last analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man 's deepest experience -- the religious .

A gyro-stabilized platform system , using restrained gyros , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination . 
The restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , neglecting transient effects , as follows : Afj where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro . 
The platform angle \*\* yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling . 
This is normally termed the gyro input axis , 90-degrees away from the gyro output or \*\* yj axis . 
The gyro angular momentum is defined by H . 
Thus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the \*\* yf axis , the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Afj if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Afj . 
It is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes .

sentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . 
The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . 
There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . 
Thus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley 's hymns are as follows . 
`` A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify '' . 
In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have .

There are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . 
Mollusks are a case in point . 
The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . 
Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . 
There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . 
The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . 
By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence .

The following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record synchronizers , inquiry synchronizers , and alteration switches . 
The declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 ) . 
Continuation cards Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder coding sheet . 
When this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that `` Continuation Cards '' may be used . 
Thus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow . 
The label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ; i.e. , it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet . 
The operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation cards but may end with the comma following any parameter . 
Remarks may appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces .

it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` structuring '' experience . 
It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like '' as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . 
This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . 
Responses such as `` rope with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of rope '' , were quite characteristic . 
Guilford-Martin personality inventories . 
The three personality inventories ( Guilford ; ; Guilford-Martin ; ; Guilford-Martin ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects .
