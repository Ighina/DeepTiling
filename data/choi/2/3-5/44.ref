one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? 
These items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . 
There does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . 
With respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . 
To this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute .

Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees ' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . 
When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle 's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . 
But when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there '' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . 
This is Baseball 1961 . 
This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous .

Plainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism '' . 
Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr . 
R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel .

The nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . 
Afterward , Tennessee 's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . 
What Herter presented , said Gore , was `` not a very encouraging review '' . 
That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts .

Introduction . 
In 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . 
These are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj .

Asilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . 
`` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play '' , he commented . 
Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . 
`` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop '' , he said . 
The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming .

High-gain , photoelectronic image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicability . 
Examples of such situations are ( aerial ) night reconnaissance , the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues , special radiography in medical or industrial applications , track recording of high energy particles , etc .. High-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods ; ; some of these are listed below : ( A ) Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B ) Channel-type , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C ) Image intensifier based upon the `` multipactor '' principle , ( D ) Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers ( TSEM tubes ) , ( E ) Cascading of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope . 
Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely . 
Channel-type image intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values ; ; they suffer , however , from an inherently low resolution . 
Image intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned .

Mrs. Alice H. Reese , wife of an engineer and mother of a 23-year-old son , was awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel . 
Mrs. Reese entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals .

The primary decomposition theorem We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary . 
We can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1 . 
What can we do with the general T ? ? 
If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems .

Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . 
First , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . 
In contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls .
