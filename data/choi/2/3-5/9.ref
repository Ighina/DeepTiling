A . 
Reasons for selecting mail questionnaire method There were two methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the resources available : ( 1 ) interviews in depth with a few selected companies , and ( 2 ) the more limited interrogation of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire . 
While the method of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and circumstances of a company 's practices and opinions , it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies .

The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc . 
. 
A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian . 
For English the reduction in size is less striking .

Oslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . 
This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . 
In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems . 
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . 
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence .

Analysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . 
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . 
Impersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals .

As a result , it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government . 
It was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature .

Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . 
Some vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . 
Current programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics .

2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . 
In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . 
With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . 
Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . 
Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences .

Abstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . 
Thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . 
It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . 
A detailed energy balance of the anode was established .
