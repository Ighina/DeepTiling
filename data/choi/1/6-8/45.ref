2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . 
In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . 
With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . 
Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . 
Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . 
If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows .

the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . 
Several factors contributed to this change . 
The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . 
Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . 
Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . 
International law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense .

A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . 
But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . 
The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . 
By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . 
This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . 
Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold 's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking .

Analysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . 
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . 
Impersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . 
Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . 
For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . 
Examples Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . 
One should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas .

A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Afj as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented . 
Afj is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening . 
The lines are asymmetric and over the range of field Afj gauss and temperature Afj the asymmetry increases with increasing Afj and decreasing T . 
An isotropic resonance shift of Afj to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction . 
The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Afj of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Afj . 
The theory predicts a linear dependence of Afj on Afj , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant . 
The experimental second moment Afj conforms to the relation Afj in agreement with theory .

Emory University 's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state 's tax laws made such a step possible . 
`` Emory University 's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race '' , board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated . 
But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes . 
The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . 
`` Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions '' , the statement said . 
The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . 
An Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws . 
The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people '' .

Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel 's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor '' . 
J.H. Miller 's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . 
In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . 
This essay seeks to make that exploration . 
Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . 
He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor 's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response .

Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . 
First , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . 
In contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . 
The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . 
Second , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . 
Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets .

Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . 
Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . 
Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . 
Three weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . 
Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . 
Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported .

it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . 
It was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . 
5 . 
Poland frontiers . 
When the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia 's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . 
Starting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . 
The long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia 's advantage . 
The West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line , which was substantially Russia 's 1941 border , as the boundary between Russia and Poland .
