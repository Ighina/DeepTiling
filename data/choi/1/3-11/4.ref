Sentiment . 
Tension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . 
One of the devices for tension management is preferential mating . 
The preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study . 
The relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating . 
It would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society . 
The supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation .

Elburn , Ill . 
-- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales : `` We 've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more . 
We sold only four pickers all last year '' . 
Gus Ehlers , competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community , says his business since August 1 is running 50 % above a year earlier . 
`` Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20 % '' , he says . 
Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas . 
Paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output . 
Although the Administration 's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines .

Oslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . 
This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . 
In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems . 
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . 
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . 
Explosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . 
The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . 
There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . 
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive . 
Even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line . 
On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for .

Control of socioeconomic status It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching method . 
The structured schools were in an industrial city , with three-family tenement houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes . 
The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle - to upper-middle class , but fringed by an industrial area . 
In order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods . 
School principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas . 
An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data . 
Equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods . 
Subjects Individual differences in maturation and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement . 
Therefore , third-grade children were chosen as subjects for this study .

Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . 
Laurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter 's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults . 
Felix Kopstein states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length '' , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity . 
It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . 
Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions . 
Additional records of slow growth have been omitted . 
It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves .

Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . 
Some vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . 
Current programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . 
Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . 
The George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . 
The Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . 
The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . 
Annual authorizations of $ 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians . 
The Federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools . 
The initiative , administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts .

A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . 
But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . 
The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . 
By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . 
This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . 
Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold 's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking .

Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I 'm sorry , but we do n't have that book . 
There would n't be much demand for it , I 'm afraid '' . 
Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . 
What to buy out of the year 's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? 
What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? 
Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . 
A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $ 500 annually , which includes the librarian 's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world 's richest city .

Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . 
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . 
Siebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits .

the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . 
For many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . 
It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . 
Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . 
In fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . 
Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . 
A measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began . 
The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $ 12.50 a share .
