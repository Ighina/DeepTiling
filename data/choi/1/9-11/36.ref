The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place . 
The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . 
The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr .. `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' . 
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . 
It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . 
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' . 
Merger proposed However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' . 
The City Purchasing Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' . 
It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem .

Austin , Texas -- A Texas halfback who does n't even know the team 's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games . 
Time stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field . 
Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of football . 
Moritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he 's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl . 
That 's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries . 
He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State . 
Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . 
But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you 'll get the quick response , `` place-kicker '' . 
A 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking .

individual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration , fermentation , salting , chemical treatment , canning , refrigeration , and freezing . 
The basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter , to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects , and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of harvest or production to areas of consumption . 
In earlier years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival . 
In the more sophisticated atmosphere of today 's developed nations , food-preservation techniques have } sought also to bring variety , peak freshness , and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the consumer . 
With the development of nuclear technology , isotopic materials , and machine radiation sources in recent years , the possibilities of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the United States and throughout the world . 
An early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled . 
Interest remained , however , in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing , or without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations . 
Factors responsible for the spoilage of foods The chief factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuffs are ( 1 ) microorganisms such as bacteria , molds , and yeasts , ( 2 ) enzymes , ( 3 ) insects , ( 4 ) sprouting , and ( 5 ) chemical reactions . 
Microorganisms are often responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods .

2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . 
In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . 
With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . 
Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . 
Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . 
If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . 
There are several closely related inner functions . 
In the last analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man 's deepest experience -- the religious . 
Man is first religious ; ; the instrumentalities follow .

: talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy 's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . 
High up on the President 's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . 
On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . 
Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . 
To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . 
The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . 
The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . 
Through Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; and one U.S. official said : `` The key question now is which side picks up the phone first '' . 
On the Latin American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ) . 
Main purpose of the meeting : To discuss President Kennedy 's Alliance for Progress . 
And that was not all .

A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies . 
These include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses . 
Modifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators . 
Abelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose . 
Speer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Afj . 
Fahey and Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti-A and anti-B agglutinins from preisolated \*\* yg-globulin samples . 
In the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson , and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described . 
Materials and methods samples . 
Serum samples were obtained from normal group A , group B and group O donors .

6.4 . 
The primary decomposition theorem We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary . 
We can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1 . 
What can we do with the general T ? ? 
If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . 
First , T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed .

artists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . 
To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . 
At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . 
Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . 
And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . 
The storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men 's minds . 
Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself . 
In the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world . 
The ninth century was in its artistic work `` the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future '' , and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated .

Asilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . 
`` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play '' , he commented . 
Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . 
`` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop '' , he said . 
The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . 
There have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . 
`` The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries '' , Buchheister told the delegates . 
In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including Point Reyes ; ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; ; stronger water pollution control programs , and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil . 
The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon Society . 
Mrs. Norman Livermore , president of the Marin Conservation League , handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W. Buchheister , president of the Society .

one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? 
These items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . 
There does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . 
With respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . 
To this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . 
It is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor 's tax attributes . 
Such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code . 
Refund claims Section 203 of the United States Code voids an assignment of a claim against the Government unless made after it has been allowed , the amount due has been ascertained , and a warrant for its payment has been issued . 
If it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions , this section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for taxes paid by a transferor corporation , even though the reorganization meets the requirements of section 381 ( a ). A clearly recognized exception is a statutory merger or consolidation . 
The leading case , Seaboard Air Line Railway v. United States , held that the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor , and it has been consistently followed . 
The Court said the purpose of the section was principally to spare the Government the embarrassment and trouble of dealing with several parties , one of them a stranger to the claim , and to prevent traffic in claims , particularly tenuous claims , against the Government .
