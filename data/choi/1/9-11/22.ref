reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . 
And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . 
One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . 
Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . 
Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . 
The double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . 
For more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . 
By all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution . 
The first , or double-step , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of its application to railroads ( and other transportation agencies ) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission . 
The Cost Section distinguishes between ( directly ) variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter .

emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . 
In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . 
Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . 
Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . 
A previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . 
It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . 
In addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates . 
But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex . 
MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions . 
It should be added that in man neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity . 
Previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response .

A royal decree issued in 1910 , two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms . 
Further decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 . 
In 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered . 
But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors . 
A unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time . 
The whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933 . 
General responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la Main-d'Oeuvre ( AIMO , Afj Direction , Afj Direction Generale , Gouvernement Generale ) . 
Tribal authorities , the chiefs and their secretaries , were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories , under the general supervision of district officials . 
The district officials , along with their other duties , were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics . 
The regulations require the inscription of each individual ( male or female , adult or child ) on a separate card ( fiche ) . 
The cards , filed by circonscription ( sub-chiefdom , or village ) , are kept in the headquarters of each territoire ( chiefdom ) .

Purification of the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E.F. Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems . 
( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . 
The proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Afj in Afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with Afj . 
The precipitate was washed twice with an 80 % saturated solution of Afj , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen . 
( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) . 
( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Afj potassium phosphate and Afj . 
Preparation of frozen sections The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al ( 1951 ) . 
Root and stem tumors from sweet clover plants infected with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen , embedded in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 \*\* ym in a cryostat maintained at -16-degrees to -20-degrees . 
The sections were mounted on cold slides smeared with Haupts ' adhesive ( Johansen , 1940 ) in earlier experiments , and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components reported by Schramm and Rottger ( 1959 ) . 
The latter adhesive was found to be much more satisfactory . 
The sections were then thawed by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a fan for 30 minutes ; ; until used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks .

City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city . 
Estimates of the city 's loss in the $ 344,000 job have ranged as high as $ 200,000 . 
Shortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors . 
The Hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said . 
The Controller 's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : The city has sued for the full amount of the $ 172,400 performance bond covering the contract . 
The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project . 
The signature of Harold V. Varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project . 
Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor . 
Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter .

These societies can expect to face difficult times . 
As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction . 
National leaders will have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men 's sense of identity . 
Feelings of a community of interest will have to be recreated -- in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for the first time -- on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past . 
Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped . 
The United States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . 
Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face . 
At the same time , we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts . 
It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable tasks at home .

Washington on President-elect John F. Kennedy 's Convair , the Caroline , winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal , Cinemactor Peter Lawford , Jack Kennedy 's brother-in-law . 
Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital 's National Guard Armory . 
Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival : `` It 's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia . 
I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans '' ! ! 
As the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory 's $ 100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $ 10,000 each . 
The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper , who regularly makes up ladies ' ensembles . 
Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered `` two of everything '' just `` in case he spills anything '' , Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing . 
A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps , General David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless New Year '' greeting to his Pentagon staff . 
Said Leatherneck Shoup : `` A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands . 
After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on .

The plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant . 
The Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for its maintenance . 
It has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill . 
Fire District No. 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment . 
The sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street . 
As new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School Street are served by it . 
B.J. Connell is the present treasurer and manager . 
The 1946 town meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center , Depot , and Way 's Lane . 
The committee submitted a report signed by Louis Martin and Leon Wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report . 
The layout of the sewer lines was designed by Henry W. Taylor , who was the engineer for the Manchester Village disposal plant .

last the White House is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master American craftsman , Duncan Phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U.S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings . 
The American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion 's library . 
The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800 's . 
The gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey , whose famous estate , `` Tranquility '' , was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover , N. J .. Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago . 
This acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs . 
The AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy 's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home . 
It is the AID 's intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of Americana '' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall . 
The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe furniture . 
The AID has found a mantlepiece attributed to Samuel McIntyre of Salem , Mass. , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792 . 
The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and is being fitted over the White House library fireplace . 
It will be painted to match the paneling in the room .
