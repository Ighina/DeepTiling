Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . 
Some vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . 
Current programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . 
Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . 
The George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . 
The Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . 
The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . 
Annual authorizations of $ 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians . 
The Federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools .

Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . 
The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . 
The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . 
These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . 
In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . 
A well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio . 
Hard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork . 
The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders . 
In addition , many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products .

Introduction Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use . 
Although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups . 
The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia . 
Report of case This patient was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . 
In 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood transfusions were given over a period of 4 years . 
Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered foci of fibrosis '' suggestive of myelofibrosis . 
No additional transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily . 
This medication was continued until February , 1958 . 
In February , 1958 , the patient suffered a myocardial infarction complicated by pulmonary edema . 
Additional findings at this time included cardiomegaly , peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans , and cholelithiasis . 
The hemoglobin was 11.6 gm .. Therapy included digitalization and anticoagulation .

Anglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age . 
Hrothgar 's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf 's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous ' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . 
Nothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . 
Since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . 
That such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny . 
Milman Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived ; ; he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas . 
Proceeding from Parry 's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata , Francis P. Magoun , Jr. , argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations , and the thesis is striking and compelling . 
Yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment : Beowulf and the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent . 
The bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very skilful oral poet , but it appears safe to assume that no sustained narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty , even in a language of many terminal inflections . 
Assonance seems nearly as severe a curb , although in a celebrated passage William of Malmesbury declares that A Song Of Roland was intoned before the battle commenced at Hastings .

the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . 
B. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . 
However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . 
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . 
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . 
In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . 
If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . 
It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . 
On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Afj and then to Afj as the active iodinating species .

There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . 
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . 
The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . 
( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . 
) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . 
The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used . 
These differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer 's vocabulary is based on Swadesh 's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined . 
Swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley . 
The result is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; ; and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4 . 
Swadesh , and therefore Hoijer , felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera ( ox , vulture , salmon , yellow pine , manzanita ) ; ; their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , bark , root ) . 
The groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as in size .

a few years , foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral , and important , phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight . 
Urethane foam , as only one example , was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955 . 
Yet last year 's volume probably topped 100 million lb. and expectations are for a market of 275 million lb. by 1964 . 
Many of the other foamed plastics , particularly the styrenes , show similar growth potential . 
And there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated . 
As this issue goes to press , for example , one manufacturer has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength ; ; another reports that a cellular polypropylene , primarily for use in wire coating applications , is being investigated . 
On the following pages , each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail , as to properties , applications , and methods of processing . 
It might be well to point out , however , some of the newer developments that have taken place within the past few months which might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved . 
In urethane foams , for example , there has been a definite trend toward the polyether-type materials ( which are now available in two-component rigid foam systems ) and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot molding . 
Most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on formulating fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets . 
Urethane foam as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention .

Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . 
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . 
Siebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . 
Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . 
A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . 
House throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . 
Catcher Frank House 's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . 
Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run . 
Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A 's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani 's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair 's glove into center .

Salem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month 's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . 
It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . 
William Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . 
At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . 
But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . 
No request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . 
Board oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year 's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . 
The contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $ 8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . 
Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes .

Philadelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . 
Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 a year . 
He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . 
The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw 's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer . 
Williams is a defensive coach . 
Gauer works with the ends . 
Choice was expected The selection had been expected . 
Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry . 
Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . 
Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player .
