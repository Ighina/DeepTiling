The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . 
Gary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . 
Arnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . 
`` Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . 
And that is just what happened on the last few holes . 
The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . 
Player was the first to feel its teeth . 
After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday 's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player 's game rapidly fell to pieces . 
He bogeyed the 10th . 
After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th . 
He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 .

Organization : In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances . 
T.V. Barker , who developed the classification-angle system , was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931 . 
The compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University Museum at Oxford . 
Since 1948 the working headquarters has been the Department of Geology and Mineralogy . 
Numerous cooperating individuals in Great Britain , Holland , the United States , and Belgium have contributed editorially or by making calculations . 
Great interest and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee . 
Financial and material help have come from academic , governmental , and industrial organizations in England and Holland . 
Editors for Volumes 1 , and 2 , were M.W. Porter and the late R.C. Spiller , both of Oxford University . 
A third volume remains to be published .

It is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient 's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway . 
One learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice 's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrot-like . 
The content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . 
One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . 
Eventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny '' ? ? 
At first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city . 
Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . 
At another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother-introject began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' ! ! 
I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; ; but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you '' ! ! 
Again , I at first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication , and I quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak , with such utter conviction , of an opinion held by my father , now several years deceased . 
Then I replied , coldly , `` If you despise me , why do n't you say so , directly '' ? ?

a simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by Afj . 
These are real analytic periodic functions with period T . 
In the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares . 
This theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in Afj . 
The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Afj there are families of such cubes . 
Here , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results . 
A square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C . 
Indeed , the spiral Afj , with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses only one inscribed square . 
The square has one corner point on the straight line segment , and does not lie entirely in the interior . 
On C , from the point P at Afj to the point Q at Afj , we construct the chord , and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as S approaches zero the square is inside C .

: talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy 's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . 
High up on the President 's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . 
On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . 
Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . 
To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . 
The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . 
The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . 
Through Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; and one U.S. official said : `` The key question now is which side picks up the phone first '' . 
On the Latin American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ) . 
Main purpose of the meeting : To discuss President Kennedy 's Alliance for Progress .

Vincent G. Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced Monday by Charles E. Raymond , District Attorney . 
Ierulli will replace Desmond D. Connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by March 31 . 
Ierulli , 29 , has been practicing in Portland since November , 1959 . 
He is a graduate of Portland University and the Northwestern College of Law . 
He is married and the father of three children . 
Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E.M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night . 
Martin , who has been in office in Washington , D.C. , for 13 months spoke at the council 's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel . 
He told some 350 persons that the United States ' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths . 
`` We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours '' , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty . 
Patience needed Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union .

it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` structuring '' experience . 
It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like '' as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . 
This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . 
Responses such as `` rope with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of rope '' , were quite characteristic . 
Guilford-Martin personality inventories . 
The three personality inventories ( Guilford ; ; Guilford-Martin ; ; Guilford-Martin ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects . 
These were the same subjects who were given the Rorschach test . 
Some predictions had been made concerning factors R , N , I and Co on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity . 
Only Co differentiated between the two groups at less than the 5 % level ( Afj ) . 
One prediction had been made about the difference in security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their Kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not . 
The nonreactors had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably `` secure '' nonreactors and `` secure '' reactors being used as the groups for comparative personality studies .

There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . 
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . 
The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . 
( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . 
) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . 
The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used . 
These differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer 's vocabulary is based on Swadesh 's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined . 
Swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley . 
The result is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; ; and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4 .

A royal decree issued in 1910 , two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms . 
Further decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 . 
In 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered . 
But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors . 
A unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time . 
The whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933 . 
General responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la Main-d'Oeuvre ( AIMO , Afj Direction , Afj Direction Generale , Gouvernement Generale ) . 
Tribal authorities , the chiefs and their secretaries , were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories , under the general supervision of district officials . 
The district officials , along with their other duties , were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics .

Abstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . 
Thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . 
It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . 
A detailed energy balance of the anode was established . 
The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . 
The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Afj . 
Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities . 
Introduction The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation . 
The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode . 
In free-burning electric arcs , for instance , approximately 90 % of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of Afj as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere . 
In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50 % of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode .
