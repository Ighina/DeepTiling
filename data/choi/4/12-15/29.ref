The most beautiful bed of pansies I 've seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day . 
Pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in { the glaring sun . 
I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather . 
He seemed puzzled by my question . 
`` I just love them '' , he said . 
The more I talked with him , the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming . 
Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care . 
He planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist . 
These specialists , I learned , have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers . 
Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains . 
I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants . 
Occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did ; ; but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run down '' .

He was in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing . 
There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; ; it was always the same unqualified success now . 
He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values . 
Stowey Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality . 
He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; ; he rose at half-past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop . 
This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist . 
The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor . 
His files , desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos . 
Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac . 
Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house . 
He worked standing , with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person 's hand . 
Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved . 
It all seemed -- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows -- as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler 's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss 's work . 
This air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine .

The group , upon the issuance of its first press release on December 21 , 1957 , designated itself a `` Committee of Investigation '' . 
In the course of its inquiry , it took testimony from only seven witnesses . 
It heard Bang-Jensen twice and his lawyer , Adolf A. Berle , Jr. , once . 
Its second press release was on January 15 , 1958 , and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed . 
It also implied that Paul Bang-Jensen had been irresponsible . 
On January 18 , Ernest Gross conducted a press conference at the U.N. lasting an hour . 
Here , he openly attacked Bang-Jensen and referred to his `` aberrant conduct '' . 
This conference was held despite Stavropoulos ' assurance to Adolf Berle , who was leaving the same day for Puerto Rico , that nothing would be done until his return on January 22 , except that the Secretary General would probably order the list destroyed . 
On January 24 Paul Bang-Jensen , accompanied by Adolf Berle , was met by Dragoslav Protitch and Colonel Frank Begley , former Police Chief of Farmington , Conn. , and now head of U.N. special police . 
The four , bundled in overcoats , mounted to the wind-swept roof of the U.N . 
There , Begley lit a fire in a wire basket , and Bang-Jensen dropped four sealed envelopes into the flames . 
In one of these he said were notes on the identities of the eighty-one refugees . 
The method of destroying the evidence embarrassed Paul Bang-Jensen .

Wage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . 
The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries . 
While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2 . 
Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented . 
The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny . 
Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit-maximizing '' and `` entry-limiting '' prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . 
The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . 
In order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public-limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . 
For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages . 
Part 1 , below describes this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions . 
Part 2 , discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant conclusions . 
Part 3 , discusses the empirical relevance and policy implications of the conclusions . 
Part 4 , is a brief summary . 
The Mathematical Appendix presents the rigorous argument , but is best read after Part 1 , in order that the assumptions underlying the equations may be explicit. 1 , the assumptions of the model A .

he had done on his first Imperial sortie a year and a half before , Lewis trekked southeast through Red Russia to Kamieniec . 
Thence he pushed farther south than he had ever been before into Podolia and Nogay Tartary or the Yedisan . 
There , along the east bank of the Southern Bug , opposite the hamlet of Zhitzhakli a few miles north of the Black Sea , he arrived at General Headquarters of the Russian Army . 
By June 19 , 1788 , he had presented himself to its Commander in Chief , the Governor of the Southern Provinces , the Director of the War College -- The Prince . 
Catherine 's first war against the Grand Turk had ended in 1774 with a peace treaty quite favorable to her . 
By 1783 her legions had managed to annex the Crimea amid scenes of wanton cruelty and now , in this second combat with the Crescent , were aiming at suzerainty over all of the Black Sea 's northern shoreline . 
Through most of 1787 operations on both sides had been lackadaisical ; ; those of 1788 were going to prove decisive , though many of their details are obscure . 
To consolidate what her Navy had won , the Czarina was fortunate that , for the first time in Russian history , her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command under her favorite Giaour . 
Potemkin was directing this conflict on three fronts : in the Caucasus ; ; along the Danube and among the Carpathians , in alliance with the Emperor Joseph 's armies ; ; and in the misty marshlands and shallow coastal waters of Nogay Tartary and Taurida , including the Crimean peninsula . 
Here the war would flame to its focus , and here Lewis Littlepage had come . 
Potemkin 's Army of Ekaterinoslav , totaling , it was claimed , 40,000 regular troops and 6,000 irregulars of the Cossack Corps , had invested Islam 's principal stronghold on the north shore of the Black Sea , the fortress town of Oczakov , and was preparing to test the Turk by land and sea . 
During a sojourn of slightly more than three months Chamberlain Littlepage could see action on both elements . 
As his second in command The Prince had Marshal Repnin , one-time Ambassador to Poland . 
Repnin , who had a rather narrow face , longish nose , high forehead , and arching brows , looked like a quizzical Mephistopheles . 
Some people thought he lacked both ability and character , but most agreed that he was noble in appearance and , for a Russian , humane .

the entrance side of the shelter , each roof beam is rested on the inside 4 inches of the block wall . 
The outside 4-inch space is filled by mortaring blocks on edge . 
The wooden bracing between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall . 
Mortar is poured between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding . 
( For details see inset , fig. 5 . 
) The first one or two roof boards ( marked `` E '' in fig. 6 ) are slipped into place across the roof beams , from outside the shelter . 
These boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams , from inside the shelter . 
Concrete blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards . 
The roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together . 
Work on the roof continues in this way . 
The last roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter . 
When the roof blocks are all in place , the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position . 
The structure is complete .

The nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . 
Afterward , Tennessee 's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . 
What Herter presented , said Gore , was `` not a very encouraging review '' . 
That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . 
While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . 
1 ) Cuba . 
Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . 
President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . 
`` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure '' , said the President . 
`` That limit has now been reached '' . 
Through Secretary Herter , Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision . 
Kennedy , through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk , declined . 
He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and Latin America ( see the hemisphere ) . 
2 ) Laos .

The United States is always ready to participate with the Soviet Union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace with justice . 
Certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the United States has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of any nation ; ; by the same token , we reject any Soviet attempt to impose its system on us or other peoples by force or subversion . 
Now this concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with more than forty other nations in a common defense effort . 
Not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these countries ; ; we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our solemn commitments to them . 
We and our friends are , of course , concerned with self-defense . 
Growing out of this concern is the realization that all people of the Free World have a great stake in the progress , in freedom , of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations . 
These peoples , desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels of living must not , by our neglect , be forced to seek help from , and finally become virtual satellites of , those who proclaim their hostility to freedom . 
But they must have technical and investment assistance . 
This is a problem to be solved not by America alone , but also by every nation cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide help . 
In recent years America 's partners and friends in Western Europe and Japan have made great economic progress . 
The international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of the early postwar years . 
No longer is the United States the only major industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries . 
To remain secure and prosperous themselves , wealthy nations must extend the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will inspire hope , confidence , and progress .

There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone . 
Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the crowds and common happenstance . 
If you 've travelled in Europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you 've had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic . 
Following a guide , and gratefully so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new . 
However , after you 've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe , you 'll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places . 
The champagne at Troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour D'Argent . 
You can relive history and follow , in fancy , the Crusaders in their quest for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of Italy 's boot . 
And you do n't meet the folks from home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the Middle Ages . 
Time stands still as you climb the narrow , stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns , perched atop lofty crags , their faces turned to the sea . 
They 've been there since the days of the Moors and the Saracens . 
And what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman 's village on the Mediterranean ? ? 
An almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road . 
For those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage .

the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . 
Several factors contributed to this change . 
The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . 
Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . 
Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . 
International law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . 
Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared . 
In both respects , international law was Europeanized . 
It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions . 
On the one hand , the major European nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality -- thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience . 
But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world . 
Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere .
