recollection he has said : `` Natural or man-made objects kept coming into my head , but I would suppress them sternly '' . 
Moreover , he organized the movement of his forms , within his rigorously shaped space , into highly complex equilibriums ; ; and used gradations of color value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors . 
The worthy Mondrian , seeing these pictures , said in a tone of kindly reproof : `` But you are really an artist of the naturalistic tradition '' ! ! 
Helion did not realize it at the time , but it was true . 
His `` monumental '' abstraction , made up of smooth , metallic `` non-objects '' acting upon each other with great tension , won Helion much acclaim during the 'thirties . 
The play of novel lighting effects also entered into these compositions , whose controlled power and varied activity made them well worth meditating . 
As Helion 's work showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature , the pure abstractionists expressed some disapproval ; ; but Leger , Arp , Lipchitz and Alexander Calder , at the time , gave him their blessing . 
His canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be `` Figures In Space '' , or `` Blue Figure '' , or `` Pink Figure '' ; ; and they had ( vaguely ) heads and feet . 
Exhibited in shows in London in 1935 , and in New York the following year , the new , more elaborated abstracts were much favored in the circles of the modernists as three-dimentional dramas of great intellectual coherence . 
At this period the thirty-year old Helion was ranked `` as one of the mature leaders of the modern movement '' , according to Herbert Read , `` and in the direct line of descent from Cezanne , Seurat , Gris and Leger '' . 
In America , Meyer Schapiro observed that , unlike the Mondrian school , Helion `` sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the framework of abstract art '' . 
It is notable that at this time he was writing with admiration of Cimabue 's and Poussin 's way of filling space . 
Abstract art was still the right path for him ; ; but , he held , instead of continuing as an `` art of reduction '' , it must grow , must make a place for the contributions of the Raphaels and Poussins as well as for those of the early cubists and Mondrian . 
Later Helion wrote of this phase : `` For years I built for myself a subtle instrument of relationships -- colors and forms without a name .

The most beautiful bed of pansies I 've seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day . 
Pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in { the glaring sun . 
I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather . 
He seemed puzzled by my question . 
`` I just love them '' , he said . 
The more I talked with him , the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming . 
Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care . 
He planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist . 
These specialists , I learned , have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers . 
Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains . 
I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants . 
Occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did ; ; but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run down '' .

this enumeration is , it barely hints at the diverse perceptions of Jews , collectively or individually , that have been attested by their Gentile environment . 
It is reasonable to affirm two propositions : Jews have been perceived by non-Jews as all things to all men ; ; some Jews have in fact been all things to all men . 
In the arena of power Jews have at one time or another been somebody 's ally ; ; they have observed correct neutrality ; ; they have been someone 's enemy . 
In the market place Jews have in fact under various circumstances been valued customers and suppliers , or clannish monopolists and cutthroat competitors . 
And so on through the roles referred to in the previous paragraph . 
Diversity of perception , yes ; ; diversity of fact , yes . 
But the two do not invariably or even typically coincide . 
The `` conventional '' image of a particular time and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as established over the years by scholarly and scientific research . 
Conventional images of Jews have this in common with all perceptions of a configuration in which one feature is held constant : images can be both true and false . 
The genuinely interesting question , then , becomes : What factors determine the degree of realism or distortion in conventional images of Jews ? ? 
The working test of `` the facts '' must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation to relevant situations . 
Granted , such `` functional '' images are subject to human error ; ; they are self-correcting in the sense that they are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against error . 
In accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors can be usefully distinguished : current intelligence ; ; predispositions regarding intelligence . 
General Grant may have been the victim of false information in the instance reported in this book ; ; if so , he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed to bad information and dubious estimates of the future . 
But General Grant may have been self-victimized .

the days of the Founding Fathers , America faces a stern test . 
That test , as President Kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his State of the Union message , will determine `` whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure '' . 
It is well then that in this hour both of `` national peril '' and of `` national opportunity '' we can take counsel with the men who made the nation . 
Incapable of self-delusion , the Founding Fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they had confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty . 
Seven Founders -- George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison and John Jay -- determined the destinies of the new nation . 
In certain respects , their task was incomparably greater than ours today , for there was nobody before them to show them the way . 
As Madison commented to Jefferson in 1789 , `` We are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us . 
Our successors will have an easier task '' . 
They thought of themselves , to use Jefferson 's words , as `` the Argonauts '' who had lived in `` the Heroic Age '' . 
Accordingly , they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity . 
Their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but , rather , as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen , that `` with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved '' . 
Strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences . 
Even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off , enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation . 
Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary .

The next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers . 
On the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way . 
Seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn . 
A hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth . 
In situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education . 
Campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found `` little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence '' , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues . 
The few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . 
In general , it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy , and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values , which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society . 
There have been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy . 
If there were more such cases , it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers favor their own social classes . 
There is currently a major controversy of public education in which group interests and values are heavily engaged . 
This is the issue of segregated schools in the South .

emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . 
In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . 
Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . 
Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . 
A previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . 
It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . 
In addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates . 
But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex . 
MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions . 
It should be added that in man neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity . 
Previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response . 
The visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory , but this topic is beyond the scope of this paper .

each song he gave verbal footnotes . 
The songs Sandburg sang often reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely or in fragments . 
Often these listeners would refer Sandburg to persons who had similar ballads or ditties . 
In due time Sandburg was a walking thesaurus of American folk music . 
After he had finished the first two volumes of his Lincoln , Sandburg went to work assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him . 
He rummaged , found composers and arrangers , collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization with musicians , ballad singers , and musicologists . 
The result was a collection of 280 songs , ballads , ditties , brought together from all regions of America , more than one hundred never before published : The American Songbag . 
Each song or ditty was prefaced by an author 's note which indicated the origin and meaning of the song as well as special interest the song had , musical arrangement , and most of the chorus and verses . 
The book , published in 1927 , has been selling steadily ever since . 
As Sandburg said at the time : `` It is as ancient as the medieval European ballads brought to the Appalachian Mountains , it is as modern as skyscrapers , the Volstead Act , and the latest oil well gusher '' . 
Schopenhauer never learned Sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer . 
Two things contribute to his popularity . 
First , Carl respects his audience and prepares his speeches carefully .

a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents do n't want sonny-boy to `` lift all those old barbell things '' because `` you 'll stunt your growth '' or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like `` Hey lookit Mr. America ; ; whaddya gonna do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time ) '' ? ? 
After all , a guy 's gotta have a little ego ! ! 
Therefore it 's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ! ! 
This happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr. Canada -- Henri De Courcy . 
Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments . 
Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority , Professor Roland Claude . 
And they could n't have entrusted Henri to better hands because `` le professeur '' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth . 
That 's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt. Royal East in Montreal . 
Undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) . 
There 's Gaetan D'Amours who is our newest Mr. Canada ; ; Jean-Paul Senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago ; ; Jack Boissoneault , who was with us last month ; ; Charles Harve , who recently won the `` Most Muscular Man '' subdivision award in the Mr. Canada event ; ; and a host of others . 
Yesiree , the professor knows his muscles ! ! 
Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4 ' 10 '' '' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight .

High-gain , photoelectronic image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicability . 
Examples of such situations are ( aerial ) night reconnaissance , the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues , special radiography in medical or industrial applications , track recording of high energy particles , etc .. High-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods ; ; some of these are listed below : ( A ) Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B ) Channel-type , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C ) Image intensifier based upon the `` multipactor '' principle , ( D ) Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers ( TSEM tubes ) , ( E ) Cascading of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope . 
Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely . 
Channel-type image intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values ; ; they suffer , however , from an inherently low resolution . 
Image intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned . 
However , the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain . 
TSEM tubes have been constructed showing high gain and resolution . 
However , electrostatic focus , important for many applications , has not been realized for these devices . 
Resolution limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to chromatic aberrations . 
Furthermore , the thin film dynodes appear to have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support can not be tolerated . 
Cascaded single stages enclosed by a common envelope have been constructed with high gain and high resolution . 
These tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the coupling members . 
The electron optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one . 
The magnification may be smaller , equal , or larger than unity .

She was getting real dramatic . 
I 'd have been more impressed if I had n't remembered that she 'd played Hedda Gabler in her highschool dramatics course . 
I did n't want her back on that broken record . 
`` Nothing 's free in the whole goddam world '' , was all I could think of to say . 
When I 'd delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink . 
`` I am '' , she said . 
I 'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky Derby and how it was Thelma 's fifty dollars I was spending . 
It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days , and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch . 
Drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me . 
I was crazy about her all over again . 
It was the call of the wild all right . 
That evening turned out to be hell like all the others . 
We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill .
