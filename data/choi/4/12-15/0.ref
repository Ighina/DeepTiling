Special districts in Rhode island . 
It is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island . 
However , a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government . 
There are forty-seven special district governments in Rhode Island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the Kent County Water Authority ) . 
These forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes , to borrow money , own property , sue and be sued , and in general to exercise normal corporate powers . 
Unlike cities and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of Audits . 
It is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government . 
In addition to the collection of service charges , the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $ 450,000 . 
Fiscal years in other states comparative data . 
A review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report . 
Included in the findings are : 1 . 
Forty-six states , including Rhode Island , end their fiscal year on June 30 .

There had been signs and portents like the regular toppling over and defacing of the bust of Lauro Di Bosis near the Villa Lante and in the Gianicolo . 
Something was happening all right , slowly it is true , but you could feel it . 
The Italians felt it . 
Little things . 
An Italian poet had noticed plainclothes policemen lounging around the area of Quirinal Palace , the first time since the war . 
At least they had n't stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated , flat , dialect mispronunciation of Mussolini 's home district -- Dogumenti , per favore . 
But , who knew , that might be coming one of these days . 
There were other Italians who still bore scars they had earned in police station basements , resisting . 
They laughed and , true to national form and manners , never talked long or solemnly on any subject at all , but some of them worried out loud about short memories and ghosts . 
We saw Giuseppe Berto at a party once in a while , tall , lean , nervous and handsome , and , in our opinion , the best novelist of them all except Pavese , and Pavese is dead . 
Berto 's The Sky Is Red had been a small masterpiece and in its special way the best book to come out of the war . 
Now he was married to a beautiful girl , had a small son , and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the movies . 
On his desk was a slowly accumulating treatment and script of The Count Of Monte Cristo . 
On his bookshelves were some of the latest American novels , including Bellow 's Seize The Day , but he had n't read them ( they were sent by American publishers ) and was n't especially interested in what the American writers were up to .

Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics . 
We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry . 
The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality . 
When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering . 
The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities . 
The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery . 
We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research . 
Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy machine . 
Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis . 
Commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit TV and audio systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices . 
In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow 's commonplace equipment originates . 
From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research . 
Ultraviolet microscopy Many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation .

the hole was found at last and plugged . 
Another week passed and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage . 
The sickness was gone and , after all , the two young couples were on their honeymoon . 
The only lasting difficulty was the food . 
In spite of Pickering Dodge 's explicit instructions regarding variation of meals , the food did not seem the same as at home . 
`` Everything tasted differently from what it does on land and those things I was most fond of at home , I loathed the most here '' , Ann noted . 
At last they concluded that the heavy , full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise . 
Walking was the remedy , they decided , but a deck full of chicken coops and pigpens was hardly suitable . 
Skipping was the alternative . 
A rope was found and , like children in school , the missionaries skipped for hours at a time . 
Finally , tiring of so monotonous a form of exercise , they decided to dance instead . 
It was much more fun , reminding the girls of their old carefree days in the Hasseltine frolics room at Bradford . 
The weather turned warmer and with it came better appetites , although Harriet was still a little off-color . 
She could not face coffee or tea without milk , and was always craving types of food that were not available aboard a sailing ship . 
By now she was sure she was going to have a baby , deciding it would be born in India or Burma that November .

1613 on , if the lists exist , they contain between twenty to thirty names . 
As the total number of incepting bachelors in 1629 was , according to Masson ( Life , 1:218 ) and n , two hundred fifty-nine , the twenty-four names listed in the ordo senioritatis for that year constitute slightly less than one tenth of the total number of bachelors who then incepted . 
There were four from St. John 's and four from Christ 's , three from Pembroke , and two from each of the colleges , Jesus , Peterhouse , Queens ' , and Trinity , with Caius , Clare , King 's , Magdalene , and Sidney supplying one each in the ordo senioritatis . 
The list was headed by ( Henry ) Hutton of St. John 's who was matriculated from St. John 's at Easter , 1625 . 
He became a fellow of Jesus in 1629 , proceeded M.A. from Jesus in 1632 , and was proctor in 1639-40 . 
The second name was ( Edward ) Kempe , matriculated from Queens ' College at Easter , 1625 . 
He proceeded M.A. in 1632 , and B.D. in 1639 , being made fellow in 1632 . 
He was ordained deacon 16 June and priest 22 December 1633 . 
The third name was ( John ) Ravencroft , who was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1631 . 
The fourth name was ( John ) Milton of Christ 's College , followed by ( Richard ) Manningham of Peterhouse , who matriculated 16 October 1624 . 
Venn gave his B.A. as 1624 , a mistake for 1629 . 
Manningham also proceeded M.A. in 1632 and became a fellow of his college in that year . 
( John ) Boutflower of Christ 's was twelfth in the list , coming from Perse School under Mr. Lovering as pensioner 20 April 1625 under Mr. Alsop . 
The fourteenth name was ( Richard ) Buckenham , written Buckman , admitted to Christ 's College under Scott 2 July 1625 .

Francois D'Albert , Hungarian-born violinist who made his New York debut three years ago , played a return engagement last night in Judson Hall . 
He is now president of the Chicago Conservatory College . 
His pianist was Donald Jenni , a faculty member at DePaul University . 
The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists , so that for the first half of the program , when the piano was partially open , Mr. Jenni 's playing was too loud . 
In vying with him , Mr. D'Albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone . 
This was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances , however , except in the case of the opening work , Mozart 's Sonata in A ( K. 526 ) , which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion . 
Brahm 's Sonata in A , although also vigorous , stood up well under the two artists ' strong , large-scale treatment . 
Mr. D'Albert has a firm , attractive tone , which eschews an overly sweet vibrato . 
He made the most of the long Brahmsian phrases , and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance . 
A Sonata For Violin And Piano , called `` Bella Bella '' , by Robert Fleming , was given its first United States performance . 
The title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer , who is also a member of the National Film Board of Canada . 
The work 's two movements , one melodically sentimental , the other brightly capricious , are clever enough in a Ravel-like style , but they rehash a wornout idiom .

she were not at home , Mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there . 
Sometimes , Mrs. Coolidge would close herself in the Green Suite on the second floor , and play the piano she had brought to the White House . 
Mama knew she was playing her son 's favorite pieces and feeling close to him , and did not disturb her . 
All the rest of the days in the White House would be shadowed by the tragic loss , even though the President tried harder than ever to make his little dry jokes and to tease the people around him . 
A little boy came to give the President his personal condolences , and the President gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in . 
Backstairs , the maids cried a little over that , and the standing invitation was not mentioned to Mrs. Coolidge . 
The President was even more generous with the First Lady than he had been before the tragedy . 
He would bring her boxes of candy and other presents to coax a smile to her lips . 
He brought her shawls . 
Dresses were short in the days of Mrs. Coolidge , and Spanish shawls were thrown over them . 
He got her dozens of them . 
One shawl was so tremendous that she could not wear it , so she draped it over the banister on the second floor , and it hung over the stairway .

thermonuclear war be set off by accident ? ? 
What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ? ? 
Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? ? 
Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? ? 
Will the danger increase or decrease ? ? 
I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon , in the White House , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` Sherwood Forest '' . 
I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons '' that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons . 
To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow 's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched . 
There is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate . 
`` Readiness exercises '' are almost continuous . 
Each could be the real thing . 
In the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since `` E hour '' . 
`` E '' stands for `` execution '' -- the moment a `` go order '' would unleash an American nuclear strike . 
There is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks . 
They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels , switches , flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines .

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . 
The current monthly payroll comes to about $ 15,000,000 . 
Howard E. Simpson , the railroad 's president , said , `` A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action '' . 
The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . 
Salary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . 
There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . 
2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . 
Since the railroad can not reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman said . 
Those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages . 
The spokesman said the number to be furloughed can not be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job . 
A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $ 18 at Franklin and Mount Streets . 
The victim , Norman B. Wiley , 38 , of the 900 block North Charles Street , was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery . 
The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got out of the cab with his money . 
The victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit . 
He said the assailant , who was armed with a automatic , entered the taxi at Pennsylvania Avenue and Gold Street .

The soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world . 
In the United States , where half of the world crop is grown , soybeans are processed for their edible oil . 
The residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds . 
Soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient . 
American chemists , seeking to increase exports of soybeans , have adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh of Indonesia . 
Soybean flour , grits , flakes , `` milk '' , and curd can be bought in the United States . 
Peanuts are the world 's second most important legume . 
They are used mainly for their oil . 
We produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed . 
Blanched peanuts , as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts , are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off . 
Cereal grains , supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans , comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of Asia and Africa . 
In western Europe and North America , where the level of economic development is higher , grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed . 
Rather , meat and potatoes , sugar , and dairy products are the main sources of carbohydrate , protein , oils , and fats . 
People depend less on seeds for foods in Australia , New Zealand , and Argentina , where extensive grazing lands support sheep or cattle , and the consumption of meat is high . 
Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world 's cereal crop in 1957-1958 .
