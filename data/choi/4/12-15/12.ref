what the many feed additives can do and how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef , dairy , and sheep men . 
The target chart quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what . 
All the additives listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration of the federal government . 
All comments concerning effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with Afj . 
This article assumes that the rations you are feeding your beef , dairy cattle , and sheep are adequately balanced with protein , vitamins , and minerals . 
The drug 's chemical name is listed , since most states require feed processors to use this name instead of the trade name on the feed tag . 
In some instances , the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical name . 
This indicates that this drug is being marketed under one trade name only or state regulatory organizations have approved its use on the feed tag . 
Here 's your feed additive guide for ruminants : drug 's chemical name : Oxytetracycline hydrochloride ( Terramycin ) what it does : Increases rate of gain and improves feed efficiency , aids in the prevention or treatment ( depending on level fed ) of the early stages of shipping fever , prevents or treats bacterial diarrhea , and aids in reducing incidence of bloat and liver abscesses . 
Milk production may be increased by the anti-infective properties of this drug . 
How to feed : beef cattle ( finishing ration ) -- To increase rate of gain and improve feed efficiency , feed 75 milligrams per head in daily supplement . 
Calves -- To increase rate of gain and improve feed efficiency , feed 10 to 25 grams per ton of complete feed . 
As an aid in the prevention of bacterial diarrhea ( scours ) , feed 50 grams per ton of complete feed . 
For the treatment of bacterial scours , feed 100-200 grams .

Hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-12-foot beam and every inch a family boat . 
Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view . 
Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom , bunks for three , galley and marine toilet . 
The gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit . 
All are well distributed , not crowded together near the stern . 
And with passenger weight shifted forward , Hotei levels off for speed under power of a Merc 800 . 
The 80-hp motor drives her at 25 mph with six aboard ! ! 
With only two aboard , Hotei does better than 27 mph -- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop . 
She also banks into a turn like a fine runabout -- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser . 
Nor is she a wet boat . 
We 've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry . 
A lot of thought went into storage space construction . 
There 's a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items .

contemporary literature is a major effort to counterbalance Existentialism and restore some of its former lustre to the tarnished image of the species Man , or , as Malraux himself puts it , `` to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves ''. 1 , Andre Malraux 's The Walnut Trees Of Altenburg was written in the early years of the second World War , during a period of enforced leisure when he was taken prisoner by the Germans after the fall of France . 
The manuscript , presumably after being smuggled out of the country , was published in Switzerland in 1943 . 
The work as it stands is not the entire book that Malraux wrote at that time -- it is only the first section of a three-part novel called La Lutte avec l'Ange ; ; and this first section was somehow preserved ( there are always these annoying little mysteries about the actual facts of Malraux 's life ) when the Gestapo destroyed the rest . 
If we are to believe the list of titles printed in Malraux 's latest book , La Metamorphose Des Dieux , Vol. 1 ( ( 1957 ) , he is still engaged in writing a large novel under his original title . 
But as he remarks in his preface to The Walnut Trees , `` a novel can hardly ever be rewritten '' , and `` when this one appears in its final form , the form of the first part will no doubt be radically changed '' . 
Malraux pretends , perhaps with a trifle too self-conscious a modesty , that his fragmentary work will accordingly `` appeal only to the curiosity of bibliophiles '' and `` to connoisseurs of what might have been '' . 
Even in its present form , however , the first part of Malraux 's unrecoverable novel is among the greatest works of mid-twentieth century literature ; ; and it should be far better known than it is . 
The theme of The Walnut Trees Of Altenburg is most closely related to its immediate predecessor in Malraux 's array of novels : Man 's Hope ( 1937 ) . 
This magnificent but greatly underestimated book , which bodies forth the very form and pressure of its time as no other comparable creation , has suffered severely from having been written about an historical event -- the Spanish Civil War -- that is still capable of fanning the smoldering fires of old political feuds . 
Even so apparently impartial a critic as W.H. Frohock has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece of Loyalist propaganda ; ; and has then gone on to argue , with unimpeachable consistency , that all the obviously non-propagandistic aspects of the book are simply inadvertent `` contradictions '' . 
Nothing , however , could be farther from the truth . 
The whole purpose of Man 's Hope is to portray the tragic dialectic between means and ends inherent in all organized political violence -- and even when such violence is a necessary and legitimate self-defense of liberty , justice and human dignity .

He remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of the final , desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy . 
When the victory cheer went up this officer found himself still mounted , with his horse pressed broadside against Cleburne 's log parapet in a tangled group of infantrymen . 
His hat was gone , the tears were streaming from his eyes . 
He never knew how he got there . 
Six climactic minutes in an individual 's life left no memory . 
Eight hundred and sixty-five Rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day . 
Eight field guns were captured in position . 
Seven battle flags and fourteen officers ' swords were sent to Thomas ' headquarters . 
It was the only sizable assault upon infantry and artillery behind breastworks successfully made by either side during the Atlanta campaign . 
The Fourteenth Regiment of Ohio Volunteers lost one-third of its numbers within a few minutes , among them being several men whose time of service had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment . 
The Thirty-eighth Regiment of Ohio Volunteers , one of the regiments in Thomas ' First Division during Buell 's command , suffered its greatest loss of the war in this action . 
A popular belief grew up after the war that the only time during the Civil War that Thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up Stanley for this assault . 
Sherman was responsible for the story when he said in his memoirs that this was the only time he could recall seeing Thomas ride so fast . 
While Thomas ' injured back led him to restrain his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly enough when he had to .

Berlin remain divided ? ? 
The inference has been too widely accepted that because the Communists have succeeded in building barricades across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city . 
So far as the record is concerned , the Western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so . 
Though Walter Ulbricht , by grace of Soviet tanks , may be head man in East Germany , that does not give him any right to usurp the government of East Berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone . 
The wartime protocol of September 12 , 1944 , designated a special `` Greater Berlin '' area , comprising the entire city , to be under joint occupation . 
It was not a part of any one of the three ( later four ) zones for occupation by Soviet , American , British , and French troops respectively . 
After the Berlin blockade and airlift , the Council of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose `` to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of Germany and of Berlin '' . 
For some time the Communists honored the distinction between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas . 
Then they moved offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany . 
That this and the closing of the East Berlin-West Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which Britain , France , and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter 's gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other West German officials to West Berlin . 
The Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin -- and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard Eisler . 
The British and other replies to that Moscow note pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities `` to integrate East Berlin into East Germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of East Germany '' . 
They insisted on the `` fundamental fact '' that `` the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite status '' . 
This is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact . 
There remains , of course , the question of what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts .

Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . 
Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . 
Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . 
Three weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . 
Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . 
Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . 
Both Cook 's and Russell 's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion . 
General manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished . 
On February 17 , Russell and Cook were sent to the Pena Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting out ranches the company had purchased . 
While talking with Julian M. Beall , Francisco Archuleta and Juan Marcus appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for a while , rode away . 
It was nearly sundown before they finished the business with Beall and began riding down the stream . 
They had traveled only a short distance when they spotted five Mexicans riding along a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them . 
Suspecting an ambush , the two deputies decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into Catskill . 
After spending two nights ( Wednesday and Thursday ) in Catskill , the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business . 
They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old Garnett Lee ranch .

one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? 
These items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . 
There does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . 
With respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . 
To this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . 
It is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor 's tax attributes . 
Such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code . 
Refund claims Section 203 of the United States Code voids an assignment of a claim against the Government unless made after it has been allowed , the amount due has been ascertained , and a warrant for its payment has been issued . 
If it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions , this section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for taxes paid by a transferor corporation , even though the reorganization meets the requirements of section 381 ( a ). A clearly recognized exception is a statutory merger or consolidation . 
The leading case , Seaboard Air Line Railway v. United States , held that the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor , and it has been consistently followed . 
The Court said the purpose of the section was principally to spare the Government the embarrassment and trouble of dealing with several parties , one of them a stranger to the claim , and to prevent traffic in claims , particularly tenuous claims , against the Government . 
Neither reason , said the Court , applied to the case at hand ; ; furthermore , Congress could not be presumed to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states . 
Other exceptions are assignments for the benefit of creditors , corporate dissolutions , transfers by descent , or transfers by subrogation . 
Exceptions are often classified as transfers by `` operation of law '' .

Nowhere before in Malraux 's pages have we met such impassioned defenders of a `` quality of man '' which transcends the realm of politics and even the realm of action altogether -- both the action of Malraux 's early anarchist-adventurers like Perken and Garine , and the self-sacrificing action of dedicated Communists like Kyo Gisors and Katow in Man 's Fate .

A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic eruption . 
The most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883 ; ; it raced across the Pacific at 300 miles an hour , devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high , and pounded the shore as far away as San Francisco . 
The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves . 
Whether or not Plato 's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times . 
Indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood . 
One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1 , 1755 ; ; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast . 
Tsunami are rare , however , in the Atlantic Ocean ; ; they are far more common in the Pacific . 
Japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 . 
The Hawaiian Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years . 
In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea ; ; one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay . 
A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( Ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been . 
In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes . 
The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement .
