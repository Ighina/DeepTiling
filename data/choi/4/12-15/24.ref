Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees ' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . 
When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle 's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . 
But when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there '' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . 
This is Baseball 1961 . 
This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous . 
It is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ; ( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate 's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ; ( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ; and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . 
Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal . 
Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion . 
Whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division . 
Of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy . 
This , of course , is baseball 's most remarkable mark : The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , George Herman ( Babe ) Ruth of the Yankees . 
Since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth 's record and each , in turn , has been thwarted . 
What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth 's amazing September surge .

the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . 
Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm 's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . 
To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . 
In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . 
These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . 
The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . 
The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . 
It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . 
Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas . 
It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's , which would confirm the date he assigns it . 
But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography ; ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 . 
When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each . 
( It makes no real difference that Braque 's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal , while Picasso 's is on canvas and eked out in oil . 
) By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done . 
But here again , the surface-declaring device both overshoots and falls short of its aim .

Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge . 
For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned . 
One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers . 
The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David -- nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . 
Public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : Too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . 
And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . 
Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department of Jewish Affairs . 
Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection . 
Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? ? 
Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr. Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies . 
Interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke off the flow . 
But there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and New York . 
In each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin 's dictatorship ; ; in the United States the initiation of militant anti-Communism , with the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard . 
These trials were properly termed `` political cases '' in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences .

Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not . 
It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited . 
The mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways . 
On the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed . 
As a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client . 
For this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine . 
On the other hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; ; no client would ever think of asking him to do such things . 
Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder . 
Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves . 
He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished . 
Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman . 
He is , first and foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society . 
It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective .

Criticism is as old as literary art and we can set the stage for our study of three moderns if we see how certain critics in the past have dealt with the ethical aspects of literature . 
I have chosen five contrasting pairs , ten men in all , and they are arranged in roughly chronological order . 
Such a list must naturally be selective , and the treatment of each man is brief , for I am interested only in their general ideas on the moral measure of literature . 
Altogether , the list will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones , for these critics range all the way from censors to those who consider art above ethics , all the way from Plato to Poe . 
And most of the great periods are represented , because we will compare Plato and Aristotle from the golden age of Greece ; ; Stephen Gosson and Sir Philip Sidney from renaissance England ; ; Dr. Johnson and William Hazlitt of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England ; ; and James Russell Lowell and Edgar Allan Poe of nineteenth century American letters . 
Plato and Aristotle Plato and Aristotle agree on some vital literary issues . 
They both measure literature by moral standards , and in their political writings both allow for censorship , but the differences between them are also significant . 
While Aristotle censors literature only for the young , Plato would banish all poets from his ideal state . 
Even more important , in his Poetics , Aristotle differs somewhat from Plato when he moves in the direction of treating literature as a unique thing , separate and apart from its causes and its effects . 
All through The Republic , Plato attends to the way art relates to the general life and ultimately to a good life for his citizens . 
In short , he is constantly concerned with the ethical effects . 
When he discusses the subject matter of poetry , he asks what moral effect the scenes will have . 
When he turns briefly to literary style , in the Third Book , he again looks to the effect on the audience . 
He explains that his citizens must not be corrupted by any of the misrepresentations of the gods or heroes that one finds in much poetry , and he observes that all `` these pantomimic gentlemen '' will be sent to another state .

They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury 's expense . 
They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if it were the source of such reports . 
Few things are more perilous for the State Department than a displeased congressman . 
The reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are so available . 
First , the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters . 
The farmers may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department 's budget . 
Businessmen will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department . 
Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department ; ; the Chamber of Commerce , assaults upon the Treasury . 
A kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . 
The congressman 's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense Department . 
Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every voter who can write . 
With all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly .

Sentiment . 
Tension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . 
One of the devices for tension management is preferential mating . 
The preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study . 
The relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating . 
It would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society . 
The supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation . 
The newlyweds building homes on the same land with either set of parents , and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive relationship . 
As Loomis remarks , `` In the internal pattern the chief reason for interacting is to communicate liking , friendship , and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic relations '' . 
Achieving . 
Maintenance of the status quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today . 
Yet , the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought about by the war . 
Prior to World War 2 , there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after World War 2 . 
Norms . 
The norms , as elements , refer to `` all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual and group actions in any social system '' .

the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence . 
During the Brown trial , however , the state 's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments . 
The Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' . 
The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history . 
While the Daily Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men . 
Editor Foss stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' . 
The Providence Daily Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings . 
The Providence Daily Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace . 
On October 31 , 1859 , John Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder . 
For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 . 
Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia . 
Although Rhode Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John Brown 's trial with extreme interest . 
On Wednesday morning , November 2 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fair trial .

Sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called `` Oakwood Heights '' . 
As a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $ 14,000 range . 
But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular . 
Its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point . 
This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation , with principal offices in New York State . 
Its president is Otis M. Waters , partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters , 540-K Chrysler Bldg. , New York City . 
Vice-president is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter . 
Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft Distributors , Inc. , Newburgh , N.Y .. The idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty . 
Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U.S. and Canada , even overseas , write to Fueloil & Oil Heat to inquire if it 's feasible and where it is being done . 
Its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March , 1950 issue . 
This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered . 
Rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family . 
Common complaints included `` Mrs. Murphy '' leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air fan , or the family was visiting `` Aunt Minnie '' with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil .
