the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence . 
During the Brown trial , however , the state 's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments . 
The Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' . 
The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history . 
While the Daily Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men . 
Editor Foss stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' . 
The Providence Daily Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings . 
The Providence Daily Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace . 
On October 31 , 1859 , John Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder . 
For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 . 
Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia . 
Although Rhode Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John Brown 's trial with extreme interest . 
On Wednesday morning , November 2 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fair trial .

There were fences in the old days when we were children . 
Across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circles . 
Alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one 's head , but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them . 
Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses ; ; front fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle . 
Square corner - and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage ; ; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail : high-pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable . 
On these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang . 
The only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree . 
The primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that can not at the time have impressed us . 
What one actually remembers is its greenness . 
From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible . 
One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower . 
Every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit trees . 
In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet-shrub , snowball , rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead . 
From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block . 
That was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch .

what the many feed additives can do and how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef , dairy , and sheep men . 
The target chart quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what . 
All the additives listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration of the federal government . 
All comments concerning effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with Afj . 
This article assumes that the rations you are feeding your beef , dairy cattle , and sheep are adequately balanced with protein , vitamins , and minerals . 
The drug 's chemical name is listed , since most states require feed processors to use this name instead of the trade name on the feed tag . 
In some instances , the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical name . 
This indicates that this drug is being marketed under one trade name only or state regulatory organizations have approved its use on the feed tag . 
Here 's your feed additive guide for ruminants : drug 's chemical name : Oxytetracycline hydrochloride ( Terramycin ) what it does : Increases rate of gain and improves feed efficiency , aids in the prevention or treatment ( depending on level fed ) of the early stages of shipping fever , prevents or treats bacterial diarrhea , and aids in reducing incidence of bloat and liver abscesses . 
Milk production may be increased by the anti-infective properties of this drug . 
How to feed : beef cattle ( finishing ration ) -- To increase rate of gain and improve feed efficiency , feed 75 milligrams per head in daily supplement . 
Calves -- To increase rate of gain and improve feed efficiency , feed 10 to 25 grams per ton of complete feed . 
As an aid in the prevention of bacterial diarrhea ( scours ) , feed 50 grams per ton of complete feed . 
For the treatment of bacterial scours , feed 100-200 grams . 
For prevention or treatment of bacterial scours , feed 0.1 to 5 milligrams per pound of body weight daily .

St. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . 
-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . 
Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion . 
He returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . 
Stepson vindicated The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman 's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . 
Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . 
Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . 
When the verdict came in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said : `` I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed . 
Still , I do n't wish to appear happy at somebody else 's misfortune '' . 
Lives on welfare Hengesbach , who has been living on welfare recently , said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia , 27 miles southwest of here . 
Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 . 
Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area by State Police .

All of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work . 
Is the Oedipus complex , the clinical syndrome , material for a tragedy ? ? 
If we remove ourselves for a moment from our time and our infatuation with mental disease , is n't there something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile neurosis ? ? 
I am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst 's consulting room , but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies than tragedy in life . 
A man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure in love , only makes us a little weary of man ; ; his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial . 
Now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history . 
We can also argue that the three brothers Karamazov and Smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , Dostoevsky , a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father 's woman . 
But a novel in which one man Karamazov explored the divisions within his personality would scarcely merit publication in the Psychoanalytic Quarterly . 
It is a mistake to look upon the Oedipus of Oedipus Complex as a literary descendant of Oedipus Rex . 
Whatever the psychological truth in the Oedipus myth , an Oedipus who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime , and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the secret . 
But a modern Oedipus who is doomed because he can not oppose his own childhood is only pathetic , and for renouncing the mystery in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies . 
I am suggesting that a case-history approach to the Oedipus complex is a blind alley for a storyteller . 
The best gifts of the novelist will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises the novelist may have in store for him . 
Incest is still a durable theme , but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions , and there is no better way to do this than that of concealment and symbolic representation .

atmospheric tests One of the inescapable realities of the Cold War is that it has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas . 
The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself . 
That dilemma is as much with us as ever . 
The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of Soviet tests . 
When this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late '50's -- the United States appeared to have three choices . 
It could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations . 
It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist world domination . 
Or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security . 
This third choice was in fact made . 
With the resumption of Soviet testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken . 
Once again , the United States must choose . 
And once again , the choices are much the same . 
Only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder .

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . 
The current monthly payroll comes to about $ 15,000,000 . 
Howard E. Simpson , the railroad 's president , said , `` A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action '' . 
The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . 
Salary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . 
There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . 
2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . 
Since the railroad can not reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman said . 
Those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages . 
The spokesman said the number to be furloughed can not be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job . 
A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $ 18 at Franklin and Mount Streets . 
The victim , Norman B. Wiley , 38 , of the 900 block North Charles Street , was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery . 
The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got out of the cab with his money . 
The victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit . 
He said the assailant , who was armed with a automatic , entered the taxi at Pennsylvania Avenue and Gold Street .

I have , within the past fifty years , come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the Truth and about which I have not a shadow of doubt . 
It has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions , the nature of the hope of a life beyond this . 
I have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world . 
In an amateurish , yet in a very real sense , I have followed the developments of archaeology , geology , astronomy , herpetology , and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields . 
At one time I became disturbed in the faith in which I had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both Old and New Testaments by a `` Higher Criticism '' of the Bible , to refute which I felt the need of a better knowledge of Hebrew and of archaeology , for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure . 
Doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and , like some higher critical friends , trying to continue to use the Bible as the Word of God while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations : attempting to bridge the chasm between an older , reverent , Bible-loving generation and a critical , doubting , Bible-emancipated race . 
Although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the Book , I stood outside shivering in the cold . 
In one thing the higher critics , like the modernists , however , overreached themselves , in claiming that the Gospel of John was not written in John 's time but well after the first century , perhaps as late as 150 A.D .. Now , if any part of the Bible is assuredly the very Word of God speaking through His servant , it is John 's Gospel . 
To ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower , and was not inspired directly by the Spirit of God , is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the Bible . 
Here I took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path , to which we might give the modern name of Pragmatism , or the thing that works . 
Test it , try it , and if it works , accept it as a guiding principle . 
So , I put my Bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself , and then tested it to see how it worked .

Salem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month 's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . 
It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . 
William Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . 
At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . 
But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . 
No request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . 
Board oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year 's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . 
The contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $ 8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . 
Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes . 
Acting Administrator Andrew F. Juras said that because of Field 's unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period . 
But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past '' . 
He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave '' . 
Salary termed modest Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government . 
He also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest '' in terms of the man 's responsibility . 
The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added Field 's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program .

Appointment of William S. Pfaff Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F. Tims , president of the company . 
Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned . 
The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department . 
He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school , Fortier High school and Soule business college . 
From June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps . 
While in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville , Ill .. Before entering the service , Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans . 
He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter , Karol , 13 . 
They reside at 4911 Miles Dr .. Washington -- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 . 
Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route . 
Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint . 
But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it . 
Many buildings Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government 's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments .
