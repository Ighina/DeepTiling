The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion . 
The architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . 
Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education . 
It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . 
The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . 
This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer 's training . 
We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject . 
The real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? ? 
The American Institute of Interior Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course . 
An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design , for the most part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of Schools of Art , and a further `` on the spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations .

The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor . 
Indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray . 
Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive . 
A Confederate observed that the Yankees were : `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier '' . 
Another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house '' . 
A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide '' . 
Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression . 
One wrote : `` ( I am so hungry ) I could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups '' . 
A second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia `` look like the latter end of original sin and hard times '' . 
A third remarked of slowness of Southerners : `` they moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god '' . 
Still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote : `` yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget '' .

recent months , much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future . 
And yet , despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole . 
The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle . 
This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier , and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level . 
In the electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets . 
Factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959 . 
The total value of our industry 's shipments , at factory prices , increased from $ 9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately $ 10.1 billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business -- home entertainment , military , industrial , and replacement . 
I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 . 
Home entertainment sales up Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as consoles and combinations since 1953 , dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about $ 1.9 billion , compared to $ 1.7 billion in 1959 .

the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . 
B. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . 
However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . 
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . 
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . 
In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . 
If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . 
It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . 
On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Afj and then to Afj as the active iodinating species . 
In the thyroid gland it appears that proteins ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated . 
Iodination of tyrosine , however , is not enough for the synthesis of hormone .

its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236 , 66th Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States , by means of grants-in-aid , to return disabled men and women to productive , gainful employment . 
The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social Security Act in 1935 . 
Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . 
Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78th Congress in 1943 passed P.L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure . 
Recent changes . 
Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . 
To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 ( P.L. 565 ) . 
These amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . 
Financial aspects .

history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad . 
Since the Industrial Revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed . 
Until recently . 
There have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator , willingly or not , and found he did n't like it ; ; the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work ; ; and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions . 
There have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work , to their own and the public 's dissatisfaction and loss . 
This has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology . 
The remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university `` crash '' courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates . 
But the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer . 
Some men have no talent for or interest in management ; ; forcing them into management can only create trouble . 
The old shop adage still holds : `` A good mechanic is usually a bad boss '' .

The lyric beauties of Schubert 's Trout Quintet -- its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners . 
But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems . 
Since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass , an instrument generally regarded as symphonic . 
Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . 
The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing . 
Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein . 
Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation . 
In these readings , the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown 's attire -- the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop . 
Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances .

it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` structuring '' experience . 
It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like '' as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . 
This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . 
Responses such as `` rope with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of rope '' , were quite characteristic . 
Guilford-Martin personality inventories . 
The three personality inventories ( Guilford ; ; Guilford-Martin ; ; Guilford-Martin ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects . 
These were the same subjects who were given the Rorschach test . 
Some predictions had been made concerning factors R , N , I and Co on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity . 
Only Co differentiated between the two groups at less than the 5 % level ( Afj ) .

This should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) . 
For galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste . 
This could also be used for any other skin irritation . 
Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts . 
`` Female troubles '' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier ; ; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation . 
The sufferer drinks tansy tea . 
Bruises , burns , cuts , etc. , occurred frequently on the frontier , and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too . 
Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak . 
( Doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain .

Mickie sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue . 
Al 's Little Cafe was small , dark , narrow , and filled with the mingled scent of beer , tobacco smoke , and Italian cooking . 
Hanging over the bar was an oil painting of a nude Al had accepted from a student at the Corcoran Gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke . 
The nude was small and black-haired and elfin , and was called `` Eloise '' . 
This was one place where Moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without anyone noticing him , or at least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know all the low-down . 
The other patrons were taxi drivers and art students and small shopkeepers . 
The reporters had not yet discovered that this was his hideaway . 
His friend Jane was with him . 
She was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did weigh too much and did n't own the mint . 
She was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash , and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury * . 
This meant sorting out press clippings and the like .
