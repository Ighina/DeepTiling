Radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener . 
Lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible . 
The mushrooming of FM outlets , offering concerts ( both jazz and classical ) , lectures , and other special events , is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity . 
Not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at Negro listeners -- an audience which , in the United States , comprises some 19,000,000 people with $ 20,000,000,000 to spend each year . 
Of course , the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching . 
He even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised -- despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials . 
But the growing number of Negro-appeal radio stations , plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers , give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects . 
It is estimated that more than 600 stations ( of a total of 3,400 ) do a significant amount of programing for the Negro . 
At least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states . 
These and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of Sponsor magazine , a trade publication for radio and TV advertisers . 
For 10 years Sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the Negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio .

Mischa Elman shared last night 's Lewisohn Stadium concert with three American composers . 
His portion of the program -- and a big portion it was -- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin : to wit , the Mendelssohn and the Tchaikovsky . 
That is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man ; ; Mr. Elman is 70 years old . 
There were 8,000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard Elman . 
But , with all due respects and allowances , it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet , more mannered than musical . 
The occasion was sentimental ; ; so was the playing . 
The American part of the evening consisted of Paul Creston 's Dance Overture , William Schuman 's `` Chester '' From `` New England Triptych '' and two works of Wallingford Riegger , Dance Rhythms , Op. 58 , and a Romanza For Strings , Op. 56A . 
The Creston is purely a potboiler , with Spanish , English , French and American dances mixed into the stew . 
The Riegger , with its Latin hesitation bounce , is just this side of the pale ; ; like his sweet , attractive Romanza , it belongs to what the composer called his `` Non-Dissonant ( Mostly ) '' category of works .

The death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal . 
The straight line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality . 
But how can one figure symbolize both ? ? 
Christianity declares that in the life and death of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal concur . 
Perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as Irenaeus . 
To be the Savior and the Lord , Jesus Christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own ; ; he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with man 's history . 
Yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind . 
His history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it . 
His death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of Jesus .

Sing Sing 's prisoner strike was motivated by a reasonable purpose , a fair break from parole boards . 
But once the strike trend hits hoosegows , there is no telling how far it may go . 
Inmates might even demand the 34-hour week , all holidays off and fringe benefits including state contributions toward lawyers ' fees . 
Some day we might see a Federation of Prison and Jail Inmates , with a leader busily trying to organize reformatory occupants , defendants out on bail , convicts opposed to probation officers , etc .. A three-day confinement week , with a month 's vacation and shorter hours all around could be an ultimate demand from cell occupants of the nation , with fringe benefits including : 1 . 
Wider space between iron bars and agreement by prison boards to substitute rubber in 20 per cent of metal . 
2 . 
An agreement allowing convicts to pass on type of locks used on prison doors . 
In case of a deadlock between prison boards and inmates , a federal arbitration board to include a `` lifer '' and two escapees should decide the issue . 
3 . 
Specific broadening of travel rights .

One hundred years ago there existed in England the Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom . 
Representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the Roman and Anglican Churches , and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in fact , was condemned by the Holy Office in 1864 . 
Now again in 1961 , in England , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity . 
The Church Unity Octave , January 18-25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches . 
Many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 . 
But it must be readily seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at least on the Catholic side . 
For the `` tide is well on the turn '' , as the London Catholic weekly Universe has written . 
I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal Newman . 
As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th-century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant-dominated country . 
Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England .

Nothing like Godot , he arrived before the hour . 
His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday , and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve . 
He was waiting . 
My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work . 
American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic . 
They find deep pessimism in them . 
Even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that `` Waiting For Godot '' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair '' . 
But to me Beckett 's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism . 
Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ? ?

The Rhode Island property tax There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well . 
For many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax . 
This tax was discontinued in 1936 . 
Since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years . 
At the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well . 
Thus , there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and , in addition , must give assistance to its local governments . 
This financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax , or at least at the rates then existing , insufficient for their requirements . 
Consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes , as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level . 
Notwithstanding state aid , the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax . 
This is being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored . 
Taxation of tangible movable property in Rhode Island has been generally of a `` hands off '' nature due possibly to several reasons : ( 1 ) local assessors , in the main , are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs , ( 2 ) the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult , and ( 3 ) the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property .

Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . 
First , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . 
In contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . 
The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . 
Second , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . 
Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . 
Third , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . 
The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . 
It is convenient to classify a child 's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line .

A former Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about maximizing Du Pont 's share of the General Motors market . 
Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were actively promoted . 
Within a few years various Du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General Motors ' eight operating divisions . 
The Fisher Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from Du Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General Motors divisions . 
Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend stemmed `` at least in part '' from the needs of General Motors outstripping Du Pont 's capacity . 
`` The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of Du Pont 's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest . 
The inference is overwhelming that Du Pont 's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit '' . 
353 U.S. , at 605 . 
This Court agreed with the trial court `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not overlooked by either Du Pont or General Motors '' .

The `` reality '' to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world . 
Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason . 
These polar concerns ( imitation vs. formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time . 
The breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes . 
Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic powers . 
The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery . 
The image of God has simply disappeared . 
All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved . 
The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems .
