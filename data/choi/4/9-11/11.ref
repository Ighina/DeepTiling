Wildlife habitat resources In 1960 one-quarter of the 92.5 million recreation visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing . 
Hunter and fisherman visits since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing licenses . 
This use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by 1972 . 
The long-range objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment . 
The wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period are : 1 . 
Revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units , assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources . 
2 . 
Inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National Forests and Grasslands are located , as a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs , including ( A ) big-game , gamebird , and small-game habitat surveys and investigations on the 186 million acres of National Forests and Grasslands , ( B ) fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81,000 miles of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes and impoundments , and ( C ) participation in planning , inspection , and control phases of all habitat improvement , land and water use projects conducted on National Forest lands by States , other Federal agencies , and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other resource values .

Sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called `` Oakwood Heights '' . 
As a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $ 14,000 range . 
But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular . 
Its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point . 
This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation , with principal offices in New York State . 
Its president is Otis M. Waters , partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters , 540-K Chrysler Bldg. , New York City . 
Vice-president is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter . 
Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft Distributors , Inc. , Newburgh , N.Y .. The idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty . 
Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U.S. and Canada , even overseas , write to Fueloil & Oil Heat to inquire if it 's feasible and where it is being done . 
Its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March , 1950 issue .

Miami , Fla. , March 17 . 
An out-of-town writer came up to Paul Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year . 
Now Richards , of course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go . 
He can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice versa . 
This happened to be vice versa , but even so , the answer was a masterpiece . 
`` It 's a whole lot easier '' , he said , `` to increase the population of Nevada , than it is to increase the population of New York city '' . 
And with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher . 
`` That is undoubtedly a hell of a quote '' , said the writer , scratching his head . 
`` Now , if I can just figure out what he 's talking about , I 'll use it '' . 
Two spots open This was just Richard 's way of saying that last year the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open .

Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning . 
This is particularly true in site selection . 
You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; ; you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed . 
With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available . 
Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible . 
These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies . 
The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site . 
These are inexpensive and available from the U.S. Geological Society , Washington 25 , D. C .. In recent years many counties and the U.S. Forest Service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use . 
Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor 's office showing ownerships of land .

Murray Louis and his dance company appeared at the Henry Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work , `` Signal '' , and the repetition of an earlier one , `` Journal '' . 
`` Signal '' is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais . 
Its abstract decor is by John Hultberg . 
Program note reads as follows : `` Take hands ; ; this urgent visage beckons us '' . 
Here , as in `` Journal '' , Mr. Louis has given himself the lion 's share of the dancing , and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements . 
Indeed , both `` Journal '' and `` Signal '' qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics . 
But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative , and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing . 
One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect , there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development . 
It may be , of course , that Mr. Louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation . 
But it may be , also , that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time . 
One thing is certain , however , and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents , phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be .

Sales and net income for the year ended December 31 , 1960 showed an improvement over 1959 . 
Net income was $ 2,557,111 , or $ 3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding , as compared to $ 2,323,867 or $ 2.82 per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares . 
Sales and other operating income increased 25.1 % from $ 24,926,615 in 1959 to $ 31,179,816 in 1960 . 
This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development . 
In spite of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959 . 
Outlook for current year Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 . 
However , the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 . 
Need for sound tax policy In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery , a sounder U.S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment , enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on Leesona 's business in the next few years . 
Such a depreciation policy would also , we believe , prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U.S. textile and other industries , thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange .

All false gods resemble Moloch , at least in the early phases of their careers , so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice . 
But there is reason in all things , and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands . 
The annual butchery of 40,000 American men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive ; ; a quota of 25,000 a year would be more than sufficient . 
No other popular idol is accorded even that much grace . 
If the railroads , for example , regularly slaughtered 25,000 passengers each year , the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety , for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the United States . 
But by comparison with the railroad , the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship , so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily . 
Yet it is plainly time to make a start , and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic , without being fanatical . 
Here , then , is what Swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning . 
From next New Year 's Day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways , publicizing it on all media of communication .

The Bishop looked at him coldly and said , `` Take it or leave it '' ! ! 
Literally , there was nothing else to do . 
He was caught in a machine . 
But Sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly : `` Let 's go and see what it 's like '' . 
Annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham , near the Georgia border and on the Tallahoosa River , a small and dirty stream . 
The city was a center of manufacture , especially in textiles , and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings , a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama . 
But it had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived -- servants and laborers huddled together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime . 
Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city over ; ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were . 
Beyond were industries and factories . 
Then they went down to Black Bottom .

The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun ( we ran a survey to find out ) but he 's always on the lookout for new and better arms . 
He 's more than a reader of outdoor articles ; ; he 's a real hunter and shooter , eager to improve his sport . 
Well , if you 're that kind of sportsman we 're here to help you . 
You 've probably given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack , but it 's not easy to decide on a new one . 
You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you 'd appreciate most ; ; the time to decide on them is now . 
As a Christmas service , I 've taken a close look at this year 's crop of new models . 
Here they are , with my comments and judgments . 
Read on , take your pick -- and start dropping those hints . 
First on my own list would be two arms -- a rifle and a handgun -- that qualify as new in the strictest sense .

the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . 
B. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . 
However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . 
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . 
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . 
In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . 
If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . 
It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . 
On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Afj and then to Afj as the active iodinating species .
