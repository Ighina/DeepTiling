They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury 's expense . 
They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if it were the source of such reports . 
Few things are more perilous for the State Department than a displeased congressman . 
The reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are so available . 
First , the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters . 
The farmers may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department 's budget . 
Businessmen will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department . 
Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department ; ; the Chamber of Commerce , assaults upon the Treasury . 
A kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . 
The congressman 's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense Department .

A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants , which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise . 
This theory eventually proved inexact . 
But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science . 
It is the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors . 
These keys are the working principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolated , or projected , to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge . 
In the autumn of 1959 , the British Broadcasting Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology . 
Three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator . 
The participants were Professor H. Bondi , professor of mathematics at King 's College , London ; ; Dr. W.B. Bonnor , reader in mathematics at Queen Elizabeth College , London ; ; Dr. R/NP.A. Lyttleton , a lecturer at St. John 's College , Cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of Cambridge ; ; and Dr. G.J. Whitrow , reader in applied mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology , London . 
Dr. Whitrow functioned as moderator .

it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . 
It was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other .

Poland frontiers . 
When the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia 's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . 
Starting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . 
The long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia 's advantage . 
The West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line , which was substantially Russia 's 1941 border , as the boundary between Russia and Poland . 
When this proposal was made , Stalin spoke with stronger emotion than at any other time during the Conference . 
He stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject .

Mickie sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue . 
Al 's Little Cafe was small , dark , narrow , and filled with the mingled scent of beer , tobacco smoke , and Italian cooking . 
Hanging over the bar was an oil painting of a nude Al had accepted from a student at the Corcoran Gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke . 
The nude was small and black-haired and elfin , and was called `` Eloise '' . 
This was one place where Moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without anyone noticing him , or at least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know all the low-down . 
The other patrons were taxi drivers and art students and small shopkeepers . 
The reporters had not yet discovered that this was his hideaway . 
His friend Jane was with him . 
She was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did weigh too much and did n't own the mint . 
She was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash , and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury * .

atmospheric tests One of the inescapable realities of the Cold War is that it has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas . 
The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself . 
That dilemma is as much with us as ever . 
The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of Soviet tests . 
When this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late '50's -- the United States appeared to have three choices . 
It could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations . 
It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist world domination . 
Or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security . 
This third choice was in fact made . 
With the resumption of Soviet testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken .

what the many feed additives can do and how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef , dairy , and sheep men . 
The target chart quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what . 
All the additives listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration of the federal government . 
All comments concerning effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with Afj . 
This article assumes that the rations you are feeding your beef , dairy cattle , and sheep are adequately balanced with protein , vitamins , and minerals . 
The drug 's chemical name is listed , since most states require feed processors to use this name instead of the trade name on the feed tag . 
In some instances , the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical name . 
This indicates that this drug is being marketed under one trade name only or state regulatory organizations have approved its use on the feed tag . 
Here 's your feed additive guide for ruminants : drug 's chemical name : Oxytetracycline hydrochloride ( Terramycin ) what it does : Increases rate of gain and improves feed efficiency , aids in the prevention or treatment ( depending on level fed ) of the early stages of shipping fever , prevents or treats bacterial diarrhea , and aids in reducing incidence of bloat and liver abscesses . 
Milk production may be increased by the anti-infective properties of this drug .

All false gods resemble Moloch , at least in the early phases of their careers , so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice . 
But there is reason in all things , and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands . 
The annual butchery of 40,000 American men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive ; ; a quota of 25,000 a year would be more than sufficient . 
No other popular idol is accorded even that much grace . 
If the railroads , for example , regularly slaughtered 25,000 passengers each year , the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety , for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the United States . 
But by comparison with the railroad , the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship , so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily . 
Yet it is plainly time to make a start , and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic , without being fanatical . 
Here , then , is what Swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning . 
From next New Year 's Day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways , publicizing it on all media of communication . 
To avoid suspicion of bigotry , let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth corpse ; ; but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners .

The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor . 
Indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray . 
Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive . 
A Confederate observed that the Yankees were : `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier '' . 
Another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house '' . 
A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide '' . 
Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression . 
One wrote : `` ( I am so hungry ) I could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups '' . 
A second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia `` look like the latter end of original sin and hard times '' .

Miami , Fla. , March 17 . 
An out-of-town writer came up to Paul Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year . 
Now Richards , of course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go . 
He can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice versa . 
This happened to be vice versa , but even so , the answer was a masterpiece . 
`` It 's a whole lot easier '' , he said , `` to increase the population of Nevada , than it is to increase the population of New York city '' . 
And with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher . 
`` That is undoubtedly a hell of a quote '' , said the writer , scratching his head . 
`` Now , if I can just figure out what he 's talking about , I 'll use it '' .

American democratic thought , pointed up the relation between the Protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion , which he called the American Democratic Faith . 
Those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 . 
And he describes it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law . 
I want to say more about Gabriel 's so-called fundamental law . 
But first I want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it . 
He points out that from the time of Jackson on through World War 1 , , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America . 
He terms this early enthusiasm `` Romantic Christianity '' and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical Protestantism '' . 
Let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme . 
He says : `` beside the Protestant philosophy of Progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the United States to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy '' . 
He specifies , `` in the middle period of the Nineteenth Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism , in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism . 
But in every period it has been humanism '' .
