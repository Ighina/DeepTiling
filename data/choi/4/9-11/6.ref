Ten-year-old Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year . 
His grades had gone steadily downhill , and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school . 
Mr. and Mrs. Stewart were puzzled and concerned . 
Then one day Dick 's classmate Jimmy , from next door , let the cat out of the bag . 
The youngsters in the boys ' class had nicknamed Dick `` Bugs Bunny '' because his teeth protruded . 
When Richard 's parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist -- a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws -- their young son was interested . 
During the year that followed , Dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved -- an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance . 
Richard Stewart is no special case . 
`` The majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment '' , says Dr. Allan G. Brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field .

The Summary Report On Desegregation Progress In Education In The Middle-South Region , 1959 - 1960 '' clearly shows two pieces of information . 
The Summary Report , which was prepared for this Conference , indicates , first , that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing ; ; second , that both actual and pending desegregation is , with few exceptions , the product or result of court order . 
The Report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow . 
The Middle-South Region , as defined by the National Association of Intergroup Relations Officials ( NAIRO ) , consists of the states of Kentucky , Maryland , Tennessee , West Virginia , Delaware , Virginia and the District of Columbia . 
The states and the Nation 's Capital all have some desegregation , in fact some dating back to 1954 ; ; but the region also embraces some of the staunchest opposition . 
Desegregation has been opposed by massive resistance , interposition , pupil assignment ( with no assignments of Negro children ) , and hate bombings . 
Desegregation and court order Now let 's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order . 
First Kentucky . 
Elementary school desegregation came to Owen and Union Counties , which already had high school desegregation . 
The action was a result of a court order , the citation for which ( and for other court action mentioned in this paper ) is taken from the Summary Report for this Conference .

A Night in New Orleans '' is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club . 
The women have a reputation for giving parties that are different and are fun and this year 's promises to follow in this fine tradition . 
Mrs. H.J. Grinsfelder is chairman . 
The Louisiana city is known , of course , for its fine food , good music and its colorful hospitality `` and , when guests arrive at Philmont that night '' , says Mrs. Grinsfelder , `` that is exactly what we expect to offer them . 
We 've been working for weeks . 
The prospects look great . 
We are keeping a number of surprises under our hats . 
But we ca n't tell it all now and then have no new excitement later '' . 
Basin Street Beat But she does indicate festivities will start early , that a jazz combo will `` give with the Basin Street beat '' during the cocktail and dinner hours and that Lester Lanin 's orchestra will take over during the dancing .

Mr. Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at Loon Lake . 
The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure . 
The evening was not always spent in the same way . 
This year , on a night cool with the front of September moving in , but with plenty of summer still about , the Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod . 
The little cottage was bursting with people of all ages . 
In the midst of it all , Mr. Podger came out on the Pod porch , alone . 
He had that day attended a country auction , and he had come back with a prize . 
The prize was an old-fashioned , woven cloth hammock , complete with cross-top pillow , fringed side pieces , and hooks for hanging . 
Mrs. Podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it was , slung in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow , caressing movement .

Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not . 
It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited . 
The mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways . 
On the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed . 
As a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client . 
For this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine . 
On the other hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; ; no client would ever think of asking him to do such things . 
Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder . 
Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves . 
He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished .

the honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor . 
Occasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all . 
They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . 
I must add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . 
It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather . 
Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . 
The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind . 
Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the red Ribes sanguineum of our Pacific Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins . 
The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble : honeybees , bumblebees , and other wild bees , and also various kinds of flies .

I went in Formosa I asked the same question . 
I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy . 
I never found it among any of the Chinese with whom I spoke , though granted they were , almost all , members of the official family who , presumably , harbor official thoughts . 
But I questioned , also , professional soldiers , who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian 's dreamy irredentism . 
Their answer was : it can be done , and we will do it . 
And then I put the question as pointedly as I could directly to Chiang Kai-shek : `` In America '' , I said , `` practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the Mainland . 
What evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that , and that it can be done '' ? ? 
He smiled . 
( He always smiles -- at least at visitors , I gather . 
He smiled also at a British bloke seated next to me , who asked the most asinine questions .

All of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work . 
Is the Oedipus complex , the clinical syndrome , material for a tragedy ? ? 
If we remove ourselves for a moment from our time and our infatuation with mental disease , is n't there something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile neurosis ? ? 
I am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst 's consulting room , but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies than tragedy in life . 
A man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure in love , only makes us a little weary of man ; ; his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial . 
Now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history . 
We can also argue that the three brothers Karamazov and Smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , Dostoevsky , a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father 's woman . 
But a novel in which one man Karamazov explored the divisions within his personality would scarcely merit publication in the Psychoanalytic Quarterly . 
It is a mistake to look upon the Oedipus of Oedipus Complex as a literary descendant of Oedipus Rex . 
Whatever the psychological truth in the Oedipus myth , an Oedipus who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime , and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the secret . 
But a modern Oedipus who is doomed because he can not oppose his own childhood is only pathetic , and for renouncing the mystery in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies .

Introduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . 
The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . 
When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . 
Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . 
Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . 
The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees . 
This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence . 
For the case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components .

the term of service in Japan , each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community . 
The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support for this program . 
Musical activities the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life . 
Extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining , under skilled direction , the Choir , the Orchestra , the Band , the Glee Club , and smaller ensembles of wind and string players . 
All students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they qualify . 
Orchestra , Band , and Choir have auditions during the week preceding the first day of classes . 
The Glee Club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership . 
In addition to the many appearances of these organizations throughout the college year , there are concerts by students of the music department , by members of the music faculty , and by visiting artists . 
Student musical organizations are the Knights of Carleton and the Overtones ( men 's vocal groups ) , and the Keynotes ( a women 's singing group ) .
