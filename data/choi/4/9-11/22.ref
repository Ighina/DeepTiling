Temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - 90-degrees-F ( 29 - 32-degrees-C ) . 
The top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs .. Sixty lbs. loading is possible but 40 lbs. is adequate . 
The suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe ( thus returning suds to soap box ) and the machine is started . 
The 160-ml. bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen . 
Washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls . 
At the conclusion of the washing , 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-F ( 32 \* 0C. ) are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs , 4 liters to each tub . 
This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes . 
During the rinsing operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow from the main drain begins . 
At this point the drains are readjusted so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the 2-12 mark on the drain gauge .

Copernicus did not question it , Ptolemy could not . 
Given the conceptual context within which ancient thought thrived , how could anyone have questioned this principle ? ? 
The reasons for this are partly observational , partly philosophical , and reinforced by other aesthetic and cultural factors . 
First , the observational reasons . 
The obvious natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the heavens . 
Not only did constellations like Draco , Cepheus , and Cassiopeia spin circles around the pole , but stars which were not circumpolar rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night . 
Nor did a constellation 's stars vary in brightness during the course of their nocturnal flights . 
The conclusion -- the distances of the constellations did not vary and their paths were circular . 
Moreover , the sun 's path over earth described a segment of a great circle ; ; this was clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after noon .

It was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began . 
The rider from Concord was as good as his word . 
He came spurring and whooping down the road , his horse kicking up clouds of dust , shouting : `` They 're a-coming ! ! 
By God , they 're a-coming , they are '' ! ! 
We heard him before he ever showed , and we heard him yelling after he was out of sight . 
Solomon Chandler had n't misjudged the strength of his lungs , not at all . 
I think you could have heard him a mile away , and he was bursting at every seam with importance . 
I have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man , and when a very small man is up on a saddle , he 'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there . 
That 's understandable , and I appreciate the sentiment . 
As for this rider , I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted , so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes , I ca n't say ; ; but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction .

London , Feb. 9 -- Vital secrets of Britain 's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy 's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . 
The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . 
It is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . 
It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy 's Nautilus , the world 's first atomic submarine . 
Its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . 
Five held for trial The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . 
A full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . 
They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard . 
Gordon A. Lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be Russian although he carries a Canadian passport . 
When arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping , it was testified . 
Flashed to Moscow A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger , bookseller , and wife , Joyce .

they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit '' the termination of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean . 
Of course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows . 
Yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repelled sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man 's own action . 
I mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by `` permit '' . 
He is not talking in the main about probabilities , risks and danger in general . 
He is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing ( and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result ) as it efficaciously does some good . 
He is talking about double effects , of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other , but causes both ; ; of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknown to be among the consequences . 
This is what , in a technical sense , to `` only permit '' an evil result means . 
It means to do it and to know one is doing it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends . 
Of course , grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good `` permits '' , in this sense , the termination of the human race by human action .

Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics . 
Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn . 
Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor . 
Hot rodding is a science . 
It 's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science . 
But because science is based on mathematics does n't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician . 
A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems ; ; however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding . 
A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem . 
It places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed . 
The first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula . 
This changes the formula to an `` equation '' .

The preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist . 
Like primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth . 
But what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models ? ? 
Is it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science ? ? 
It has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation . 
This push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word `` mass '' to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied . 
( cf. Rapoport , 1959 : : Ch. 11 . 
) Here I think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent . 
The simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs to be questioned .

Mischa Elman shared last night 's Lewisohn Stadium concert with three American composers . 
His portion of the program -- and a big portion it was -- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin : to wit , the Mendelssohn and the Tchaikovsky . 
That is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man ; ; Mr. Elman is 70 years old . 
There were 8,000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard Elman . 
But , with all due respects and allowances , it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet , more mannered than musical . 
The occasion was sentimental ; ; so was the playing . 
The American part of the evening consisted of Paul Creston 's Dance Overture , William Schuman 's `` Chester '' From `` New England Triptych '' and two works of Wallingford Riegger , Dance Rhythms , Op. 58 , and a Romanza For Strings , Op. 56A . 
The Creston is purely a potboiler , with Spanish , English , French and American dances mixed into the stew . 
The Riegger , with its Latin hesitation bounce , is just this side of the pale ; ; like his sweet , attractive Romanza , it belongs to what the composer called his `` Non-Dissonant ( Mostly ) '' category of works .

When all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs . 
The run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line .
