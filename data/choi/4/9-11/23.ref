Broadway the unoriginals To write a play , the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it . 
Nowadays , more and more , all he needs is someone else 's book . 
To get started , he does not scan the world about him ; ; he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists . 
So far this season , Broadway 's premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original American stage plays . 
Best from abroad . 
Of straight dramas , there are All The Way Home , which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee novel , A Death In The Family ; ; The Wall , awkwardly based on the John Hersey novel ; ; Advise And Consent , lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller ; ; Face Of A Hero ( closed ) , based on a Pierre Boulle novel . 
The only original works attempting to reach any stature : Tennessee Williams ' disappointing domestic comedy , Period Of Adjustment , and Arthur Laurents ' clever but empty Invitation To A March . 
Clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals -- A Taste Of Honey , by Britain 's young ( 19 when she wrote it ) Shelagh Delaney ; ; Becket , by France 's Jean Anouilh ; ; The Hostage ( closed ) , by Ireland 's Brendan Behan . 
Among the musicals , Camelot came from T.H. White 's The * Once And Future King , and novels were the sources of the less than momentous Tenderloin and Do Re Mi . 
Wildcat and The Unsinkable Molly Brown were originals , but pretty bad , leaving top honors again to an import -- the jaunty and charmingly French Irma La Douce .

We often say of a person that he `` looks young for his age '' or `` old for his age '' . 
Yet even in the more extreme of such cases we seldom go very far astray in guessing what his age actually is . 
And this means , I suppose , that almost invariably age reveals itself by easily recognizable signs engraved on both the body and the mind . 
`` Young for his age '' means only the presence of some minor characteristic not quite usual . 
Stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless there . 
An assumption of youth , or the presence of a few youthful characteristics , deceives no more successfully than rouge or dyed hair . 
`` Looking young for your age '' means `` for your age '' and it means no more . 
A mind expressing itself in words may reveal itself a little less obviously as old or young . 
Its surface loses its bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways less immediately obvious than the body does . 
Youth may be , and often is , skeptical , cynical or despairing ; ; age may be idealistic , believing and much given to professions of optimism . 
But there is , nevertheless , always a subtle difference in the way in which supposedly similar opinions are held .

Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . 
The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . 
The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . 
These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . 
In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . 
A well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio . 
Hard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork . 
The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders . 
In addition , many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products .

He remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of the final , desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy . 
When the victory cheer went up this officer found himself still mounted , with his horse pressed broadside against Cleburne 's log parapet in a tangled group of infantrymen . 
His hat was gone , the tears were streaming from his eyes . 
He never knew how he got there . 
Six climactic minutes in an individual 's life left no memory . 
Eight hundred and sixty-five Rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day . 
Eight field guns were captured in position . 
Seven battle flags and fourteen officers ' swords were sent to Thomas ' headquarters . 
It was the only sizable assault upon infantry and artillery behind breastworks successfully made by either side during the Atlanta campaign . 
The Fourteenth Regiment of Ohio Volunteers lost one-third of its numbers within a few minutes , among them being several men whose time of service had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment .

Five , four , three , two , one , fire ! ! 
The tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard . 
The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach . 
Never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear . 
Nuclear weapons are fearsome , but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying . 
A great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets . 
It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent 's cities and people . 
With a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim 's people ? ? 
Would n't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation ? ?

There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . 
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . 
The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . 
( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . 
) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . 
The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used . 
These differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer 's vocabulary is based on Swadesh 's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined . 
Swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley . 
The result is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; ; and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4 .

Nothing like Godot , he arrived before the hour . 
His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday , and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve . 
He was waiting . 
My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work . 
American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic . 
They find deep pessimism in them . 
Even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that `` Waiting For Godot '' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair '' . 
But to me Beckett 's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism . 
Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ? ? 
Is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ? ?

each song he gave verbal footnotes . 
The songs Sandburg sang often reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely or in fragments . 
Often these listeners would refer Sandburg to persons who had similar ballads or ditties . 
In due time Sandburg was a walking thesaurus of American folk music . 
After he had finished the first two volumes of his Lincoln , Sandburg went to work assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him . 
He rummaged , found composers and arrangers , collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization with musicians , ballad singers , and musicologists . 
The result was a collection of 280 songs , ballads , ditties , brought together from all regions of America , more than one hundred never before published : The American Songbag . 
Each song or ditty was prefaced by an author 's note which indicated the origin and meaning of the song as well as special interest the song had , musical arrangement , and most of the chorus and verses . 
The book , published in 1927 , has been selling steadily ever since . 
As Sandburg said at the time : `` It is as ancient as the medieval European ballads brought to the Appalachian Mountains , it is as modern as skyscrapers , the Volstead Act , and the latest oil well gusher '' .

Berlin remain divided ? ? 
The inference has been too widely accepted that because the Communists have succeeded in building barricades across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city . 
So far as the record is concerned , the Western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so . 
Though Walter Ulbricht , by grace of Soviet tanks , may be head man in East Germany , that does not give him any right to usurp the government of East Berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone . 
The wartime protocol of September 12 , 1944 , designated a special `` Greater Berlin '' area , comprising the entire city , to be under joint occupation . 
It was not a part of any one of the three ( later four ) zones for occupation by Soviet , American , British , and French troops respectively . 
After the Berlin blockade and airlift , the Council of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose `` to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of Germany and of Berlin '' . 
For some time the Communists honored the distinction between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas . 
Then they moved offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany . 
That this and the closing of the East Berlin-West Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which Britain , France , and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter 's gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other West German officials to West Berlin .

That summer the gambling houses were closed , despite the threats of Pierre Ameaux , a gaming-card manufacturer . 
Dancing was no longer permitted in the streets . 
The Bordel and other places of prostitution were emptied . 
The slit breeches had to go . 
Drunkenness was no longer tolerated . 
In defiance , a chinless reprobate , Jake Camaret , marched down the aisle in St. Peter 's one Sunday morning , followed by one of the women from the Bordel , whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack of any shame . 
Plunking themselves down on the front bench , they turned to smirk at those around them . 
John 's first impulse was to denounce their blasphemy . 
But the thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him . 
Calmly he opened the Bible and read of the woman at the well .
