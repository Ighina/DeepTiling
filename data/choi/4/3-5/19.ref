Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . 
Some vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities .

Ghost town ? ? 
To the editor of the Inquirer : I just wish to congratulate Inspector Trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles . 
We have now a quiet city , fewer automobiles , less congestion , and fewer retail customers shopping in center city . 
Good for Mr. Trimmer .

Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 70th Anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya Muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because I admire the music of Prokofieff ; ; and with sober purpose , because the development of Prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . 
The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United States of America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur -- and very capable as a professional musician . 
These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-World War 1 , era .

The food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here '' ! ! 
So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from North Country School , Lake Placid , New York . 
In this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school . 
Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good .

It was not until we had returned to the city to live , while I was still at Brown and Sharpe 's , that I felt the full impact of evangelical Christianity . 
I came under the spell of a younger group in the church led by the pastor 's older son . 
The spirit of this group was that we were -- and are -- living in a world doomed to eternal punishment , but that God through Jesus Christ has provided a way of escape for those who confess their sins and accept salvation .

The farmer 's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock . 
Livestock must be tended every day , routinely . 
A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens .

our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? ? 
Here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth . 
Should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? ? 
Noting such evidence is the first step ; ; and almost the only `` cure '' is early detection and removal .

It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool -- eight enlightening , vigorous , rigorous , not wholly unrewarding years . 
We have learned a lot -- a dash of hydrochemistry here , a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there . 
We have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy . 
We have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds . 
True , our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools , thereby diluting our spectacular attractions .
