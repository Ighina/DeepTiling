Thomas Douglas , fifth Earl of Selkirk , a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River of the North . 
Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson 's Bay Company , he purchased great blocks of the Comany 's stock with the view to controlling its policies . 
Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . 
The grant , which stretched southward to Lake Traverse -- the headwaters of the Red -- was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay . 
Thus at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier .

Franklin D. Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs. Claire Shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in Bakersfield , California , several months ago as a prospective patient . 
`` Doctor '' Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes . 
Then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze .

you simply told yourself , as you handed us the book , that it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline of incantation . 
For pride 's sake , I will not say that the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into my soul . 
Besides , that particular message does no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood . 
But what you could not know , of course , was how smoothly the Victorian Fitzgerald was to lead into an American Fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents were to come , if not of age , then into a bright , taut semblance of it . 
I do not suppose you ever heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald , living or dead , and moreover I do not suppose that , even if you had , his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval .

you elect to use the Standard Deduction or the Tax Table , and later find you should have itemized your deductions , you may do so by filing an amended return within the time prescribed for filing a claim for refund . 
See You May Claim A Refund , Page 135 . 
The same is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should have used the Standard Deduction or Tax Table . 
The words amended return should be plainly written across the top of such return .

Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees ' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . 
When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle 's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . 
But when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there '' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . 
This is Baseball 1961 . 
This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous .

the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . 
For many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . 
It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . 
Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . 
In fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares .

The Rhode Island property tax There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well . 
For many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax . 
This tax was discontinued in 1936 . 
Since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years .

Do n't/RB forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces . 
Clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly .

time to time the medium mentions other people `` around him '' , who were `` on the other side '' , and reports what they are saying . 
After a while there come initials and names , and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames . 
As the hour progresses , the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements . 
There are a few prognoses of coming events .
