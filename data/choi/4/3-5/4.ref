Hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-12-foot beam and every inch a family boat . 
Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view . 
Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom , bunks for three , galley and marine toilet . 
The gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit . 
All are well distributed , not crowded together near the stern .

an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes . 
The Unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen -- as the term was then understood in the Back Bay -- and Parker was definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners . 
Ezra Stiles Gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist .

one characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . 
Much of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky 's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . 
In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages . 
Through long experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself .

Sing Sing 's prisoner strike was motivated by a reasonable purpose , a fair break from parole boards . 
But once the strike trend hits hoosegows , there is no telling how far it may go . 
Inmates might even demand the 34-hour week , all holidays off and fringe benefits including state contributions toward lawyers ' fees . 
Some day we might see a Federation of Prison and Jail Inmates , with a leader busily trying to organize reformatory occupants , defendants out on bail , convicts opposed to probation officers , etc .. A three-day confinement week , with a month 's vacation and shorter hours all around could be an ultimate demand from cell occupants of the nation , with fringe benefits including : 1 . 
Wider space between iron bars and agreement by prison boards to substitute rubber in 20 per cent of metal .

it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions at the point just reached . 
Fortunately , it is possible to be somewhat more concrete and factual in diagnosing the involvement of values in education . 
For this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological and psychological studies of students in American colleges and universities , and particularly from the Cornell Values Studies . 
In the latter research program , information is available for 2,758 Cornell students surveyed in 1950 and for 1,571 students surveyed in 1952 . 
Of the latter sample , 944 persons had been studied two years earlier ; ; hence changes in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals at two points in time .

Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre . 
Most avant-garde creators , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting . 
But Robert Rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them .

the Dominican Republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be due in large part to the U.S. show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship . 
Outwardly , Ciudad Trujillo is calm . 
None of the Trujillo family remains . 
Mr. Balaguer is in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring .

a funny experience at Newport yesterday afternoon . 
Sat there and as a woman sang , she kept getting thinner and thinner , right before my eyes , and the eyes of some 5,500 other people . 
I make this observation about the lady , Miss Judy Garland , because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a British female reporter who flattered her terribly in London recently and then wrote in the paper the next day : `` Judy Garland has arrived in London .
