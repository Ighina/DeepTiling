You can build this vacation cottage yourself . 
It is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete in every detail . 
Because of the unique design by the architect Egils Hermanovski , you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time . 
Most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools .

Introduction . 
In 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . 
These are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . 
Then in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . 
No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible .

Analysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . 
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . 
Impersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . 
Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . 
For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying .

Color was delayed until 1935 , the wide screen until the early fifties . 
Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties . 
Each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen . 
As long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further . 
Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square .

A former Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about maximizing Du Pont 's share of the General Motors market . 
Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were actively promoted . 
Within a few years various Du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General Motors ' eight operating divisions .

the original cause of the quarrel , Philip 's seizure of Gascony , was only one strand in the spider web of French interests that overlay all western Europe and that had been so well and closely spun that the lightest movement could set it trembling from one end to the other . 
Even so , Edward 's ambassadors can scarcely have foreseen that five years of unremitting work lay ahead of them before peace was finally made and that when it did come the countless embassies that left England for Rome during that period had very little to do with it . 
It is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures on the pope . 
Nogaret is hardly an impartial witness , and even he did not make his charges against Boniface until the latter was dead , but there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say . 
It was not merely a hunger for `` money , gold and precious objects '' that delayed the papal pronouncement that could have brought the war to an end ; ; the pope was playing a dangerous game , with so many balls in the air at once that a misstep would bring them all about his ears , and his only hope was to temporize so that he could take advantage of every change in the delicate balance of European affairs .

Those who have never traveled the width and length of this land can not conceive , on the basis of textbook description alone , the overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one government . 
The miracle of democratic America comes home to one most strongly only when one has seen the endless Great Plains of the Midwest ; ; the sky-reaching peaks of the Northwest mountains ; ; the smoke-filled , art-filled , drama-filled life of the great cities of the East ; ; the lush and historic charm of the South . 
Now , to add to the already unbelievable extremes found in one nation , we have the two new states of Hawaii and Alaska .
