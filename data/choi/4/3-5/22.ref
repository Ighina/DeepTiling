Men need unity and they need God . 
Care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stands . 
The statement also points to a classic paradox : The more men turn toward God , who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another . 
To be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones , with a resultant fragmentation of the human race . 
Massacres attending the partition of India and the establishment of the State of Israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender .

It was not until we had returned to the city to live , while I was still at Brown and Sharpe 's , that I felt the full impact of evangelical Christianity . 
I came under the spell of a younger group in the church led by the pastor 's older son . 
The spirit of this group was that we were -- and are -- living in a world doomed to eternal punishment , but that God through Jesus Christ has provided a way of escape for those who confess their sins and accept salvation .

Mr. O'Donnell's essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which he obviously has . 
He and also Mr. Cowley and Mr. Warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- Nathaniel Hawthorne , for example , and Herman Melville -- protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs . 
Faulkner 's total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when Mr. Cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when Mr. O'Donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the South . 
If he is a traditionalist , he is an eclectic traditionalist .

fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals . 
Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melting grease . 
Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat . 
Do n't/RB forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces .

we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion . 
Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom . 
Religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed .

cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world . 
The useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments . 
One wonders about its applicability to people . 
Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? ? 
The answer is , of course , yes .

My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds . 
Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings . 
`` Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive '' , a boy remarked . 
`` It means that you have to get ahead '' . 
When I pressed for a purely religious definition , I encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty .

A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . 
But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . 
The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . 
By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . 
This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity .
