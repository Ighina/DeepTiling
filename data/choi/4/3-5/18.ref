There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement . 
You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before . 
I ca n't tell when , but I 'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! !

The Lord is my light and my salvation ; ; whom shall I fear ? ? 
The Lord is the strength of my life ; ; of whom shall I be afraid '' ? ? 
( Psalm 27 : 1 ) A certain teacher scheduled a `` Fear Party '' for her fourth grade pupils . 
It was a session at which all the youngsters were told to express their fears , to get them out in the open where they could talk about them freely . 
The teacher thought it was so successful that she asks : `` Would n't it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries '' ? ?

Mr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power . 
In this view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the generality of Article 1 . 
If this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction . 
Federal question jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law .

The United States is always ready to participate with the Soviet Union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace with justice . 
Certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the United States has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of any nation ; ; by the same token , we reject any Soviet attempt to impose its system on us or other peoples by force or subversion . 
Now this concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with more than forty other nations in a common defense effort .

She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient . 
The fish took the bait . 
He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but -- joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned . 
But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement .

The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky . 
The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no more . 
The things left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows . 
Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and then empty of images .

sentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . 
The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . 
There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes .

Philadelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . 
Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 a year . 
He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . 
The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw 's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer .

Tenure as criterion I would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by Russell Kirk ( Dec. 16 ) . 
It has to do with teachers ' salaries and tenure . 
Next September , after receiving a degree from Yale 's Master of Arts in Teaching Program , I will be teaching somewhere -- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers . 
I will also be underpaid . 
The amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers .

the hole was found at last and plugged . 
Another week passed and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage . 
The sickness was gone and , after all , the two young couples were on their honeymoon .
