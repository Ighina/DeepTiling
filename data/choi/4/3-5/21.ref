Rhode Island Heritage Week proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , governor The theme of Rhode Island Heritage Week for 1961 will be `` Independence and Union '' . 
It commemorates the 185th anniversary of Rhode Island 's Independence when , upon May 4 , 1776 , the General Assembly , by its action , established the first free republic in the New World . 
As this year marks the centennial of the beginning of the Civil War , this fact is being commemorated with several exhibits throughout the State , but most of all paying tribute to the first Rhode Island Volunteers who rushed to the defense of the City of Washington , putting at the disposal of President Lincoln the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time . 
On April 30 , ceremonies commemorating the departure of these volunteers will take place at 1:00 P.M. at the Dexter Training Grounds in Providence . 
The Independence Day celebration will be properly observed with a big military and civic parade from West Warwick to the Greene Homestead in Anthony ; ; and now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of april 29th to may 7th , 1961 , as Rhode Island Heritage Week , advising our citizens that throughout this week many historic houses and beautiful gardens will be open to visitors as well as industrial plants , craft shops , museums and libraries and I earnestly urge all to take advantage of these opportunities to see as many of these places as they can during this outstanding week .

Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge . 
Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs. ? ?

The vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world . 
During the summer of 1960 , it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle . 
The contestants in this economic struggle are the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee ( AWOC ) of the AFL-CIO and the agricultural employers of the State . 
By virtue of the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces . 
It is not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have endeavored to maintain .

the period since the end of World War 2 , -- a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful , the unusual , and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field . 
The importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry , however , is not in terms of volume alone . 
Designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries . 
Many of today 's developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays ; ; the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers ; ; and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons , medallions , etc. , owes much to the field , as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics . 
There is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below .

Once , they were at Easthampton for the summer ( again , Fritzie said , a good place , even though they were being robbed ) . 
One soft evening -- that marvelous sea-blessed time when the sun 's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume and wrack haunts everything -- Amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk .

The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies . 
But the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life . 
The Christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a sideshow , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty .
