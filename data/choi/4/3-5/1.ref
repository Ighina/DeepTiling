The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies . 
But the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life . 
The Christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a sideshow , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty . 
The most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives . 
Most pastors and laymen , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes .

Anglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age . 
Hrothgar 's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf 's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous ' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . 
Nothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . 
Since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . 
That such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny .

the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world . 
With its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution , Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder , Joseph R. Brown , and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology . 
Joseph R. Brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise of New England between 1810 and 1830 .

Some years ago Julian Huxley proposed to an audience made up of members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science that `` man 's supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are ( now ) in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice age '' . 
As a Humanist , Dr. Huxley interests himself in the possibilities of human development , and one thing we can say about this suggestion , which comes from a leading zoologist , is that , so far as he is concerned , the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon the idea of future human evolution . 
This text from Dr. Huxley is sometimes used by enthusiasts to indicate that they have the permission of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment of psychic powers in human beings .

A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Afj as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented . 
Afj is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening . 
The lines are asymmetric and over the range of field Afj gauss and temperature Afj the asymmetry increases with increasing Afj and decreasing T .

She describes , first , the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by this `` unseasonable exultation '' ; ; he is answered by a confused , honest Englishman . 
The reasons for the Whig joy on this occasion are found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government , their delight at the prospect of a new war , their hopes of having the Tories hanged , and so on . 
As for the author of the Englishman , Mrs. Manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the Protestant cause should be left to `` Ridpath , Dick Steele , and their Associates , with the Apostles of Young Man 's Coffee-House '' .

The President 's personality would have opened that office to him . 
And for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make it a successorship by inheritance . 
It is testimony to the deep respect in which Mr. Eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached . 
These began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the President 's condition for the nation . 
And if Howard Rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession , his article in the Atlantic Monthly accomplished a good deal more .
