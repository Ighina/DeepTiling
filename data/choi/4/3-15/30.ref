tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony . 
The partners each bring to it unselfish love , and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy . 
At its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares . 
Everything else is closed away . 
This is the ideal . 
But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved . 
Instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship . 
In the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive . 
But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed .

70 North Providence taxpayers made appeals to the board of tax assessors for a review of their 1961 tax assessments during the last two days at the town hall in Centredale . 
These were the last two days set aside by the board for hearing appeals . 
Appeals were heard for two days two weeks ago . 
About 75 persons appeared at that time . 
Louis H. Grenier , clerk of the board , said that the appeals will be reviewed in December at the time the board is visiting new construction sites in the town for assessment purposes . 
They also will visit properties on which appeals have been made . 
Any adjustments which are made , Mr. Grenier said earlier this month , will appear on the balance of the tax bill since most of the town 's taxpayers take the option of paying quarterly with the balance due next year . 
John Pezza , 69 , of 734 Hartford Avenue , Providence , complained of shoulder pains after an accident in which a car he was driving collided with a car driven by Antonio Giorgio , 25 , of 12 DeSoto St. , Providence , on Greenville Avenue and Cherry Hill Road in Johnston yesterday . 
Mr. Giorgio had started to turn left off Greenville Avenue onto Cherry Hill Road when his car was struck by the Pezza car , police said . 
Both cars were slightly damaged . 
Mr. Pezza was taken to a nearby Johnston physician , Dr. Allan A. DiSimone , who treated him . 
Mr. Giorgio was uninjured . 
Thieves yesterday ransacked a home in the Garden Hills section of Cranston and stole an estimated $ 3,675 worth of furs , jewels , foreign coins and American dollars .

The U.N. 's ' gravest crisis ' Ambassador Stevenson yesterday described the U.N. 's problem of electing a temporary successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as `` the gravest crisis the institution has faced '' . 
Of course it is . 
If the decision goes wrong , it may be -- as Mr. Stevenson fears -- `` the first step on the slippery path downhill '' to a U.N. without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning . 
The integrity of the office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be , as the Charter puts it , `` the chief administrative officer of the Organization '' , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority `` external to the Organization '' . 
In other words , the Secretary General is to be a nonpartisan , international servant , not a political , national one . 
He should be , as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was , a citizen of the world .

last the White House is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master American craftsman , Duncan Phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U.S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings . 
The American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion 's library . 
The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800 's . 
The gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey , whose famous estate , `` Tranquility '' , was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover , N. J .. Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago . 
This acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs . 
The AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy 's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home .

This time he was making no mistake . 
Olgivanna -- in her country the nickname was a respectful form of address -- was not only attractive but shrewd , durable , sensible , and smart . 
No wonder Wright was enchanted -- no two better suited people ever met . 
Almost from that day , until his death , Olgivanna was to stay at his side ; ; but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying , both for Wright and his Montenegrin lady . 
It must be granted that the flouting of convention , no matter how well intentioned one may be , is sure to lead to trouble , or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval . 
Even so , many of the things that happened to Wright and Olgivanna seem inordinately severe . 
Their afflictions centered on one maddening difficulty : Miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for . 
Reporters began to trail Miriam everywhere , and to encourage her to make appalling statements about Wright and his doings . 
Flocks of writs , attachments , and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air .

there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex , there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women . 
The Peace Corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family , unless the wife is also accepted for full-time Peace Corps work on the same project . 
There should be no draft exemption because of Peace Corps service . 
In most cases service in the Corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment . 
Peace Corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the United States . 
Nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid . 
The guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services . 
Rather the principle should be akin to that of the allowance . 
Peace Corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living .

The study of the St. Louis area 's economic prospects prepared for the Construction Industry Joint Conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan St. Louis Survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the Missouri-Illinois countryside . 
St. Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region . 
Slackened regional demand for St. Louis goods and services reflects the region 's relative lack of purchasing power . 
Not all St. Louis industries , of course , have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood . 
But for those which do , the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core . 
The city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern Illinois . 
Gov. Dalton 's New Commerce and Industry Commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry . 
That is one approach .

Introduction . 
In 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . 
These are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . 
Then in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . 
No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible .

The deep water is used by many people , but it is always clean , for the washing is done outside . 
I know now why our Japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom . 
Of course , most toilets are Eastern style -- at floor level -- but even when they are raised to chair height , they are actually outside toilets -- inside .

ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful . 
The buildings are mostly Georgian . 
The Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did . 
But his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures . 
He is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be . 
He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century , down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart . 
The men 's shops on Hanover 's Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven . 
And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend , toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke , are no less rakish than those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia . 
But there has always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth . 
The would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment . 
No one here pokes fun at manly virtues . 
And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League . 
It even affects the faculty .
