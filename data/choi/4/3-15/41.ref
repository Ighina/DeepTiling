atmospheric tests One of the inescapable realities of the Cold War is that it has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas . 
The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself . 
That dilemma is as much with us as ever . 
The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of Soviet tests . 
When this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late '50's -- the United States appeared to have three choices .

their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves upward in angry motion , Papa-san sat glacier-like , his smooth solidity , his very immobility defying all the turmoil about him . 
`` Our objective '' , the colonel had said that day of the briefing , `` is Papa-san '' . 
There the objective sat , brooding over all . 
Gouge , burn , blast , insult it as they would , could anyone really take Papa-san ? ? 
Between the ponderous hulk and himself , in the valley over which Papa-san reigned , men had hidden high explosives , booby traps , and mines . 
The raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion . 
On the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire . 
At the slope 's base coils of concertina stretched out of eye range like a wild tangle of children 's hoops , stopped simultaneously , weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic of the child 's touch to start them all rolling again . 
Closer still , regular barricades of barbed wire hung on timber supports . 
Was it all vain labor ? ? 
Who would clean up the mess when the war was over ? ? 
Smiling at his quixotic thoughts , Warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down . 
Tonight a group of men , tomorrow night he himself , would go out there somewhere and wait . 
If he were to go with White , he would be out there two days , not just listening in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san , but moving ever deeper into enemy land -- behind Papa-san -- itself . 
Was this what he had expected ? ?

It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . 
While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins ' pronouncement in Pleas Of The Crown from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage . 
By making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States , 362 U.S. 525 , where the Court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . 
One need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself . 
One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . 
The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrones an unreality into a rule of law '' . 
I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed . 
But in any event , I submit that the power to depose belongs to Congress , not to this Court . 
I dissent . 
Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious objector , was convicted of violating 12a of the Universal Military Training and Service Act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces .

it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , That the Act of July 3 , 1952 ( 66 Stat. 328 ) as amended ( 42 U.S.C. 1952-1958 ) , is further amended to read as follows : Section 1 . 
In view of the increasing shortage of usable surface and ground water in many parts of the Nation and the importance of finding new sources of supply to meet its present and future water needs , it is the policy of the Congress to provide for the development of practicable low-cost means for the large-scale production of water of a quality suitable for municipal , industrial , agricultural , and other beneficial consumptive uses from saline water , and for studies and research related thereto . 
As used in this Act , the term ' saline water ' includes sea water , brackish water , and other mineralized or chemically charged water , and the term ' United States ' extends to and includes the District of Columbia , the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , and the territories and possessions of the United States .

Those who have never traveled the width and length of this land can not conceive , on the basis of textbook description alone , the overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one government . 
The miracle of democratic America comes home to one most strongly only when one has seen the endless Great Plains of the Midwest ; ; the sky-reaching peaks of the Northwest mountains ; ; the smoke-filled , art-filled , drama-filled life of the great cities of the East ; ; the lush and historic charm of the South . 
Now , to add to the already unbelievable extremes found in one nation , we have the two new states of Hawaii and Alaska . 
To hope to cover just one region of this land and to enjoy all of its sights and events and , of course , to bring back pictures of your experiences , requires advance planning . 
For this reason , U.S. Camera has prepared this special U.S.A. vacation feature . 
We divided the country into five regions plus Hawaii and Alaska and in each is included a general description of the area plus specific recommendations of places and events to cover . 
Any special photographic requirements are also given .

It is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient 's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway . 
One learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice 's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrot-like . 
The content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . 
One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . 
Eventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny '' ? ? 
At first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city . 
Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . 
At another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother-introject began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' ! ! 
I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; ; but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you '' ! ! 
Again , I at first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication , and I quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak , with such utter conviction , of an opinion held by my father , now several years deceased . 
Then I replied , coldly , `` If you despise me , why do n't you say so , directly '' ? ? 
She looked confused at this , and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make . 
It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you '' ? ?

Origin of state automobile practices . 
The practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years . 
At least one state vehicle was in existence in 1917 . 
The state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940 . 
The automobile maintenance unit , or motor pool , came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible for centralized maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that time . 
The motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive management including establishment of cost billing systems , records keeping , analyses of vehicle use , and effecting economies in vehicle operation .

Samuel Gorton , founder of Warwick , was styled by the historian Samuel Greene Arnold `` one of the most remarkable men who ever lived '' . 
A biographer called him `` the premature John the Baptist of New England Transcendentalism '' . 
The historian Charles Francis Adams called him `` a crude and half-crazy thinker '' . 
His contemporaries in Massachusetts called him an arch-heretic , a beast , a miscreant , a proud and pestilent seducer , a prodigious minter of exorbitant novelties . 
Edward Rawson , secretary of the colony of Massachusetts Bay , described him as `` a man whose spirit was stark drunk with blasphemies and insolence , a corrupter of the truth , a disturber of the peace wherever he comes '' . 
Nathaniel Morton stated he `` was deeply leavened with blasphemous and familistical opinions '' . 
He was thrown out , more or less , from Boston , Plymouth , Pocasset , Newport , and Providence . 
On the other hand , Dr. Ezra Styles recorded the following testimony of John Angell , the last disciple of Gorton : `` He said Gorton was a holy man ; ; wept day and night for the sins and blindness of the world had a long walk through the trees and woods by his house , where he constantly walked morning and evening , and even in the depths of the night , alone by himself , for contemplation and the enjoyment of the dispensation of light . 
He was universally beloved by his neighbours , and the Indians , who esteemed him , not only as a friend , but one high in communion with God in Heaven '' . 
Gorton sometimes signed himself `` a professor of the mysteries of Christ '' . 
There is plenty more to recommend Gorton , the facts of whose life are given in The Life And Times Of Samuel Gorton , by Adelos Gorton . 
He fought like a fiend for the helpless and oppressed , worked for the abolition of slavery , helped the Quakers and Indians , and worked against the prosecution of witches .

The food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here '' ! ! 
So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from North Country School , Lake Placid , New York . 
In this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school . 
Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good . 
When served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities .
