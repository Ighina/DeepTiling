The farmer 's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock . 
Livestock must be tended every day , routinely . 
A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens . 
Even if there are no livestock , the farmer can not leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season .

Sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called `` Oakwood Heights '' . 
As a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $ 14,000 range . 
But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular . 
Its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point . 
This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation , with principal offices in New York State . 
Its president is Otis M. Waters , partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters , 540-K Chrysler Bldg. , New York City . 
Vice-president is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter . 
Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft Distributors , Inc. , Newburgh , N.Y .. The idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty . 
Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U.S. and Canada , even overseas , write to Fueloil & Oil Heat to inquire if it 's feasible and where it is being done . 
Its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March , 1950 issue . 
This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered .

time to time the medium mentions other people `` around him '' , who were `` on the other side '' , and reports what they are saying . 
After a while there come initials and names , and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames . 
As the hour progresses , the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements . 
There are a few prognoses of coming events . 
Another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading . 
Some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual . 
Not all , as a matter of fact , consider themselves `` mediums '' in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased . 
In fact , some sensitives rule this out , preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( ESP ) , on this side of the `` veil '' . 
However that may be , people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons . 
Perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans . 
They may , of course , be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship . 
The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a `` control '' who speaks through an entranced sensitive .

recent months , much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future . 
And yet , despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole . 
The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle . 
This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier , and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level . 
In the electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets . 
Factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959 . 
The total value of our industry 's shipments , at factory prices , increased from $ 9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately $ 10.1 billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business -- home entertainment , military , industrial , and replacement . 
I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 . 
Home entertainment sales up Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as consoles and combinations since 1953 , dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about $ 1.9 billion , compared to $ 1.7 billion in 1959 . 
Sales of TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through July ; ; set production ( excluding those destined for the export market ) also ran ahead in the early months , but was curtailed after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic . 
For the year as a whole , retail sales of TV sets probably came to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959 ; ; however , production came to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2 million . 
In contrast to the lower turnout of TV , total radio production increased from 15.4 million sets to 16.7 million ( excluding export ) .

Washington on President-elect John F. Kennedy 's Convair , the Caroline , winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal , Cinemactor Peter Lawford , Jack Kennedy 's brother-in-law . 
Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital 's National Guard Armory . 
Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival : `` It 's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia . 
I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans '' ! ! 
As the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory 's $ 100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $ 10,000 each . 
The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper , who regularly makes up ladies ' ensembles . 
Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered `` two of everything '' just `` in case he spills anything '' , Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing . 
A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps , General David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless New Year '' greeting to his Pentagon staff . 
Said Leatherneck Shoup : `` A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands . 
After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on . 
Little geeing and hawing have been necessary '' . 
But Shoup also gave the Corps a tilling in spots . 
Speaking of `` pride '' , he deplored the noncommissioned officer `` whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940 ; ; the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window . 
A few of these people are still around '' . 
Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U.S. Senate , then went their respective ways .

You have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the Congress he has seen the Kaisers and the Hitlers and the Mussolinis , the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs , come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest Nation that mankind has ever known . 
Then I have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people . 
So , I say , Mr. Speaker , God bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the United States of America and the free world . 
You remember the words of President Kennedy a week or so ago , when someone asked him when he was in Canada , and Dean Rusk was in Europe , and Vice President Johnson was in Asia , `` Who is running the store '' ? ? 
And he said , `` The same fellow who has been running it , Sam Rayburn '' . 
General leave to extend Mr. McCormack . 
Mr. Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record ; ; and also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend their remarks . 
The speaker pro tempore .
