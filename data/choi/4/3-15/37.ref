the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English . 
Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago . 
Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present . 
In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself . 
Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family . 
On his father 's side he was of German descent , on his mother 's he came of the old Swedish nobility . 
The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Vattern in south central Sweden .

Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics . 
Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn . 
Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor . 
Hot rodding is a science . 
It 's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science . 
But because science is based on mathematics does n't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician . 
A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems ; ; however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding . 
A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem . 
It places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed .

General How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives of your benefit and service program ? ? 
Have you permitted it to become a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee morale and , consequently , increased productivity ? ? 
What effort do you make to assess results of your program ? ? 
Do you measure its relation to reduced absenteeism , turnover , accidents , and grievances , and to improved quality and output ? ? 
Have you set specific objectives for your employee publication ? ? 
Is it reaching these goals ? ? 
Is it larger or fancier than you really need ? ? 
Are you using the most economical printing methods , paper , etc .. Are there other , cheaper communications techniques that could be substituted ? ? 
Has your attitude toward employee benefits encouraged an excess of free `` government '' work in your plant ? ? 
Is your purchasing agent offering too much free-buying service for employees ? ?

the last years of Woodrow Wilson 's administration , a red scare developed in our country . 
Many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force . 
Postmaster General Burleson set about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails . 
Attorney General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more than 4,000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights . 
Then , not many years later , the Un-American Activities Committee , under the leadership of Martin Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens . 
Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government . 
This hysteria reached its height under the leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy . 
Demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions . 
New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how . 
Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency . 
They give strict interpretation to William James ' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself '' . 
They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new . 
Hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe .

She gave herself a title , Lady Diana Harrington . 
The New York D.A. gave her another , The Golden Girl of cafe society . 
Houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute . 
And Houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on September 20 , 1960 , `` Diane Harris Graham , 30 , D.O.A. , circumstances -- unusual '' . 
Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor . 
She was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top trollop who had given the world 's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour . 
She never hid the fact that she liked to play .

The soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world . 
In the United States , where half of the world crop is grown , soybeans are processed for their edible oil . 
The residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds . 
Soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient . 
American chemists , seeking to increase exports of soybeans , have adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh of Indonesia . 
Soybean flour , grits , flakes , `` milk '' , and curd can be bought in the United States . 
Peanuts are the world 's second most important legume . 
They are used mainly for their oil . 
We produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed . 
Blanched peanuts , as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts , are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off . 
Cereal grains , supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans , comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of Asia and Africa . 
In western Europe and North America , where the level of economic development is higher , grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed . 
Rather , meat and potatoes , sugar , and dairy products are the main sources of carbohydrate , protein , oils , and fats .

Her neighbors in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as `` the Golden Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial '' .

Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge . 
For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned . 
One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers . 
The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David -- nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . 
Public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : Too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . 
And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . 
Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department of Jewish Affairs . 
Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection . 
Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? ?

A Night in New Orleans '' is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club . 
The women have a reputation for giving parties that are different and are fun and this year 's promises to follow in this fine tradition . 
Mrs. H.J. Grinsfelder is chairman . 
The Louisiana city is known , of course , for its fine food , good music and its colorful hospitality `` and , when guests arrive at Philmont that night '' , says Mrs. Grinsfelder , `` that is exactly what we expect to offer them . 
We 've been working for weeks . 
The prospects look great . 
We are keeping a number of surprises under our hats . 
But we ca n't tell it all now and then have no new excitement later '' . 
Basin Street Beat But she does indicate festivities will start early , that a jazz combo will `` give with the Basin Street beat '' during the cocktail and dinner hours and that Lester Lanin 's orchestra will take over during the dancing . 
As for food , Mrs. Henry Louchheim , chairman of this phase , is a globetrotter who knows good food . 
`` New Orleans '' ? ? 
She says , `` of course I 've had the best . 
It is just bad luck that we are having the party in a month with no R 's , so no oysters . 
But we have lots of other New Orleans specialties . 
I know they will be good .
