temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet . 
That is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types of shoes . 
There are many soft and light shoe leathers available . 
Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers . 
Softness is found in crushed textures . 
Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape . 
Heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette . 
Wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights . 
Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes . 
Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps . 
Coolest shade While white is the coolest summer shade , there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color .

Writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions that man can master the principles of this cause-and-effect universe and that such mastery will necessarily better the human lot . 
On the other hand , the bright vision of the future has been directly stated in science fiction concerned with projecting ideal societies -- science fiction , of course , is related , if sometimes distantly , to that utopian literature optimistic about science , literature whose period of greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced Edward Bellamy 's Looking Backward and H.G. Wells 's A Modern Utopia . 
In Arthur Clarke 's Childhood 's End ( 1953 ) , though written after the present flood of dystopias began , we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly defined . 
Childhood 's End -- apparently indebted to Kurd Lasswitz 's Utopian romance , Auf Zwei Planeten ( 1897 ) , and also to Wells 's Histories Of The Future , especially , The World Set Free ( 1914 ) and The Shape Of Things To Come ( 1933 ) -- describes the bloodless conquest of earth by the Overlords , vastly superior creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for its next stage of development , an eventual merging with the composite mind of the universe . 
Arriving just in time to stop men from turning their planet into a radioactive wasteland , the Overlords unite earth into one world in which justice , order , and benevolence prevail and ignorance , poverty , and fear have ceased to exist .

the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world . 
With its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution , Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder , Joseph R. Brown , and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology . 
Joseph R. Brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise of New England between 1810 and 1830 .

Analysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . 
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . 
Impersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . 
Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . 
For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . 
Examples Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . 
One should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas . 
Evaluation The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . 
Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive -- and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high . 
It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired -- and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed .

Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre . 
Most avant-garde creators , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting . 
But Robert Rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them . 
He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham 's Summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity . 
For Mr. Taylor 's Images And Reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl 's cape lined with grass . 
Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor .

Another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively non-volatile . 
This work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method , and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago . 
Similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride . 
The development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion . 
In one of these , an exploding-wire device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 Afj and 100 atmospheres pressure , a major goal was achieved . 
The accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent . 
This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals . 
The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter . 
The element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire , and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy . 
This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element .

Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel 's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor '' . 
J.H. Miller 's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . 
In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . 
This essay seeks to make that exploration . 
Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . 
He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor 's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . 
It is hardly accidental , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands . 
In Great Expectations the hands become almost an obsession . 
Mr. Jaggers habitually bites his forefinger , a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness that half fascinates , half terrifies all who have dealings with him . 
Miss Havisham 's withered hands , heavy as if her unhappiness were somehow concentrated in them , move in restless self-pity between her broken heart and her walking stick . 
Pumblechook 's `` signature '' is the perpetually extended glad hand . 
Wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction by regularly rubbing his hands together . 
Old Mr. Pocket 's frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless , social-climbing wife is to `` put his two hands into his disturbed hair '' and `` make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it '' , whereas Joe Gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of Mrs. Joe by apologetically drawing `` the back of his hand across and across his nose '' . 
Such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark , were it not that in Great Expectations , as in no other of Dickens ' novels , hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme -- a kind of unifying symbol or natural metaphor for the book 's complex of human interrelationships and the values and attitudes that motivate them . 
Dickens not only reveals character through gesture , he makes hands a crucial element of the plot , a means of clarifying the structure of the novel by helping to define the hero 's relations with all the major characters , and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt , pursuit , crime , greed , education , materialism , enslavement ( by both people and institutions ) , friendship , romantic love , forgiveness , and redemption .

It is not news that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the violin . 
Certainly not in Orchestra Hall where he has played countless recitals , and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra , playing the Brahms Concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed . 
There was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat . 
Not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent . 
Those would be reserved for the orchestra 's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself . 
This time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood . 
But he had in Walter Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point .

A former Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about maximizing Du Pont 's share of the General Motors market . 
Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were actively promoted . 
Within a few years various Du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General Motors ' eight operating divisions . 
The Fisher Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from Du Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General Motors divisions . 
Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend stemmed `` at least in part '' from the needs of General Motors outstripping Du Pont 's capacity . 
`` The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of Du Pont 's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest . 
The inference is overwhelming that Du Pont 's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit '' .

The late R.G. Collingwood , a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature , once wrote `` : : We are all , though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with Chaucer and Cimabue , or even Shakespeare and Titian . 
By an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and Japanese colour-prints ; ; but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries , and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place . 
The natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art , to despise and dislike the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else '' . 
One might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general public , of the newspaper critic , and of the creative artist himself . 
There results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary . 
Such study may take many forms . 
The study of ideas in literature is one of these . 
Of course , it goes without saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene . 
He will frequently return to it . 
The continuities , contrasts , and similarities discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other . 
When we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption . 
Most students of literature , whether they call themselves scholars or critics , are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them . 
Many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding .
