Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits ; ; they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities . 
Their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes , but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe . 
Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power . 
Thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors . 
But this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities . 
Since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living . 
The royal ritual generated power into the other world : it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world . 
Proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world ; ; but naturally , the royal ritual , which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits , was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom . 
This is the familiar system of `` cosmic government '' . 
The Chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers . 
He regulated the dualities of light and darkness , Yang and Yin , which are locked in eternal struggle . 
By swaying the balance between them , he effected the alternation of the seasons . 
His power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions .

the days of the Founding Fathers , America faces a stern test . 
That test , as President Kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his State of the Union message , will determine `` whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure '' . 
It is well then that in this hour both of `` national peril '' and of `` national opportunity '' we can take counsel with the men who made the nation . 
Incapable of self-delusion , the Founding Fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they had confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty . 
Seven Founders -- George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison and John Jay -- determined the destinies of the new nation .

Die Frist ist um , und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr , the Maestro quoted The Flying Dutchman , as he told of his career and wanderings , explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times . 
The music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra , William Steinberg , has molded his group into a prominent musical organization , which is his life . 
When he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months , `` commuting '' between the two cities . 
This schedule became too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious Mr. Steinberg . 
His London contract was rescinded , and now , he explains cheerfully , as a bright smile lightens his intense , mobile face , `` I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts '' ! ! 
Our meeting took place in May , 1961 , during one of the Maestro 's stop-overs in New York , before he left for Europe . 
As we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent . 
Seeking an obscure , dark , relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine , he asked if the soft background music could be turned off . 
Unfortunately , it was Muzak , which automatically is piped into the public rooms , and which nolens volens had to be endured . 
As he talked about himself , time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe , Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled . 
Did he come from a musical family ? ? 
Yes : though not professional musicians , they were a music-loving family . 
In his native Cologne , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet . 
She even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values . 
When he started school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A , instead of C , as in the scale .

There were fences in the old days when we were children . 
Across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circles . 
Alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one 's head , but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them .

Appointment of William S. Pfaff Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F. Tims , president of the company . 
Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned . 
The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department . 
He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school , Fortier High school and Soule business college . 
From June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps . 
While in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville , Ill .. Before entering the service , Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans . 
He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter , Karol , 13 . 
They reside at 4911 Miles Dr .. Washington -- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 . 
Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route . 
Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint . 
But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it . 
Many buildings Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government 's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments . 
Of course , 1600 Pennsylvania , the White House , is the most famous address of the free world . 
Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high . 
Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old .

Mischa Elman shared last night 's Lewisohn Stadium concert with three American composers . 
His portion of the program -- and a big portion it was -- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin : to wit , the Mendelssohn and the Tchaikovsky . 
That is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man ; ; Mr. Elman is 70 years old . 
There were 8,000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard Elman . 
But , with all due respects and allowances , it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet , more mannered than musical . 
The occasion was sentimental ; ; so was the playing . 
The American part of the evening consisted of Paul Creston 's Dance Overture , William Schuman 's `` Chester '' From `` New England Triptych '' and two works of Wallingford Riegger , Dance Rhythms , Op. 58 , and a Romanza For Strings , Op. 56A . 
The Creston is purely a potboiler , with Spanish , English , French and American dances mixed into the stew . 
The Riegger , with its Latin hesitation bounce , is just this side of the pale ; ; like his sweet , attractive Romanza , it belongs to what the composer called his `` Non-Dissonant ( Mostly ) '' category of works . 
The Schuman `` Chester '' takes off from an old William Billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect . 
All these -- potboilers or no -- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively , colorful , unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors . 
It was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change .

cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world . 
The useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments . 
One wonders about its applicability to people . 
Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? ? 
The answer is , of course , yes . 
For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people . 
Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes . 
But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides . 
We have ample light when the sun sets ; ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; ; we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; ; the range of our voice ignores distance . 
At what stage are social sciences then ? ? 
Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? ? 
There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud . 
And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact .

The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor . 
Indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray . 
Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive . 
A Confederate observed that the Yankees were : `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier '' . 
Another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house '' . 
A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide '' . 
Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression . 
One wrote : `` ( I am so hungry ) I could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups '' . 
A second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia `` look like the latter end of original sin and hard times '' . 
A third remarked of slowness of Southerners : `` they moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god '' . 
Still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote : `` yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget '' .

Mr. Dooley . 
Mr. Speaker , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have . 
The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two . 
And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service . 
There have been a number of sound plans proposed . 
But none of these has been implemented . 
Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping hand . 
Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased tremendously since World War 2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million for 1947 to 1957 . 
Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New York City area . 
Here the New York Central Railroad , one of the Nation 's most important carriers , has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949 . 
At this time of crisis in our Nation 's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad 's proposal for control of the Baltimore & Ohio railroads . 
The New York Central has pointed out that this control , if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission , would give the combined C. & O. - B. & O. Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the New York Central . 
Not only is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area . 
The New York Central notes : `` The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. & O. - B. & O. provides the backbone of Central 's revenues . 
These revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter and terminal freight services .
