The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc . 
. 
A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian .

My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds . 
Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings . 
`` Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive '' , a boy remarked . 
`` It means that you have to get ahead '' . 
When I pressed for a purely religious definition , I encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty . 
`` I like the tradition '' , a girl said . 
`` I like to follow the holidays when they come along . 
But you do n't have to worship in the traditional way .

This should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) . 
For galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste . 
This could also be used for any other skin irritation . 
Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts . 
`` Female troubles '' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier ; ; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation . 
The sufferer drinks tansy tea . 
Bruises , burns , cuts , etc. , occurred frequently on the frontier , and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too . 
Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak . 
( Doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain .

their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves upward in angry motion , Papa-san sat glacier-like , his smooth solidity , his very immobility defying all the turmoil about him . 
`` Our objective '' , the colonel had said that day of the briefing , `` is Papa-san '' . 
There the objective sat , brooding over all . 
Gouge , burn , blast , insult it as they would , could anyone really take Papa-san ? ? 
Between the ponderous hulk and himself , in the valley over which Papa-san reigned , men had hidden high explosives , booby traps , and mines . 
The raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion . 
On the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire .

Plainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism '' . 
Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr . 
R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . 
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club .

Organization : In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances . 
T.V. Barker , who developed the classification-angle system , was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931 . 
The compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University Museum at Oxford . 
Since 1948 the working headquarters has been the Department of Geology and Mineralogy . 
Numerous cooperating individuals in Great Britain , Holland , the United States , and Belgium have contributed editorially or by making calculations . 
Great interest and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee . 
Financial and material help have come from academic , governmental , and industrial organizations in England and Holland .

Introduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . 
The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . 
When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . 
Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . 
Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets .

There had been signs and portents like the regular toppling over and defacing of the bust of Lauro Di Bosis near the Villa Lante and in the Gianicolo . 
Something was happening all right , slowly it is true , but you could feel it . 
The Italians felt it . 
Little things . 
An Italian poet had noticed plainclothes policemen lounging around the area of Quirinal Palace , the first time since the war . 
At least they had n't stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated , flat , dialect mispronunciation of Mussolini 's home district -- Dogumenti , per favore . 
But , who knew , that might be coming one of these days . 
There were other Italians who still bore scars they had earned in police station basements , resisting . 
They laughed and , true to national form and manners , never talked long or solemnly on any subject at all , but some of them worried out loud about short memories and ghosts . 
We saw Giuseppe Berto at a party once in a while , tall , lean , nervous and handsome , and , in our opinion , the best novelist of them all except Pavese , and Pavese is dead .

the wine waiter in a restaurant -- always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself , the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one 's dealer , and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him . 
In instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity , the situation is ideal . 
It may , on occasion , be anything but that . 
However , by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice , one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines ( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters ) and , better yet , whether he has a taste for wine . 
Again , by spreading one 's purchases over several wine dealers , one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad . 
This is important because , despite all the efforts of the French government , an appreciable segment of France 's export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty , and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas . 
A good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards , or the best parts of them ; ; he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends -- sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district . 
These are the wines the French themselves use for everyday drinking , for even in France virtually no one drinks the Grands Crus on a meal-to-meal basis . 
The Grands Crus are expensive , and even doting palates tire of them . 
And certainly , in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker , the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the Grands Crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown . 
There is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper . 
Some of them are very delicious indeed , and there are many good ones exported -- unfortunately , along with others not so good , and worse . 
Consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- `` steering ever from the known to the unknown '' -- are the requisites . 
Wine waiters are something else again ; ; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts . 
Most of them , the world over , operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and some other Latin countries : the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise , with the burden of proof on the customer himself .

Northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration . 
They have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state . 
And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons . 
The name presumably derives from the French royal house which never learned and never forgot ; ; since Bourbon whiskey , though of Kentucky origin , is at least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South . 
The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North . 
The race problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive . 
It is these other differences between North and South -- other , that is , than those which concern discrimination or social welfare -- which I chiefly discuss herein . 
I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience .
