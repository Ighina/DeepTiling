It was John who found the lion tracks . 
He found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before , and he circled once , nose to the ground , hair shooting up along his back , as it did when he was after lion or bear , and then he lifted his head and bayed , and the pack joined in , all heads high , and Jones knew it was a hot trail . 
He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain . 
This mountain was known as The Black Reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet , honeycombed with caves , top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass . 
On the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly . 
Kearton and Ulyate had started the day together while Jones followed the dogs , and Means and Loveless had taken another route , and now , with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him , Ulyate reined in , in the shadow of the Reef and pointed .

we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion . 
Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom . 
Religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed . 
How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ? 
We may feel pessimistic at the outlook . 
And yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision . 
We are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music . 
And it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith . 
Atomic energy To see this vision in perspective , we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom . 
You know that I could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima . 
It was only about the size of a baseball ; ; but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20,000 tons of Afj .

The preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist . 
Like primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth . 
But what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models ? ? 
Is it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science ? ?

City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city . 
Estimates of the city 's loss in the $ 344,000 job have ranged as high as $ 200,000 . 
Shortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors . 
The Hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said . 
The Controller 's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : The city has sued for the full amount of the $ 172,400 performance bond covering the contract . 
The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project .

the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . 
B. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . 
However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . 
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . 
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . 
In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . 
If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . 
It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . 
On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Afj and then to Afj as the active iodinating species . 
In the thyroid gland it appears that proteins ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated . 
Iodination of tyrosine , however , is not enough for the synthesis of hormone . 
The mono - and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine . 
The mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain di-iodotyrosine analogues ( Pitt-Rivers and James , 1958 ) . 
There is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under enzymatic control .

winds , the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf . 
Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit . 
He peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below . 
`` Good old iron compass '' ! ! 
He thought . 
A plume of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars , and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights . 
The girders of a shattered Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream . 
Vermont 's main railroad line was prostrate . 
And in the dark days after the Great Flood of 1927 -- the worst natural disaster in the state 's history -- the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United States mails . 
Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday , November 4 , 1927 , when officials of the Post Office Department 's Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight . 
Clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices -- those who still had offices -- and wondered how to move the mail . 
The state 's railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way : it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks .

this enumeration is , it barely hints at the diverse perceptions of Jews , collectively or individually , that have been attested by their Gentile environment . 
It is reasonable to affirm two propositions : Jews have been perceived by non-Jews as all things to all men ; ; some Jews have in fact been all things to all men . 
In the arena of power Jews have at one time or another been somebody 's ally ; ; they have observed correct neutrality ; ; they have been someone 's enemy . 
In the market place Jews have in fact under various circumstances been valued customers and suppliers , or clannish monopolists and cutthroat competitors . 
And so on through the roles referred to in the previous paragraph . 
Diversity of perception , yes ; ; diversity of fact , yes . 
But the two do not invariably or even typically coincide . 
The `` conventional '' image of a particular time and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as established over the years by scholarly and scientific research . 
Conventional images of Jews have this in common with all perceptions of a configuration in which one feature is held constant : images can be both true and false . 
The genuinely interesting question , then , becomes : What factors determine the degree of realism or distortion in conventional images of Jews ? ? 
The working test of `` the facts '' must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation to relevant situations . 
Granted , such `` functional '' images are subject to human error ; ; they are self-correcting in the sense that they are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against error . 
In accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors can be usefully distinguished : current intelligence ; ; predispositions regarding intelligence . 
General Grant may have been the victim of false information in the instance reported in this book ; ; if so , he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed to bad information and dubious estimates of the future . 
But General Grant may have been self-victimized .

recollection he has said : `` Natural or man-made objects kept coming into my head , but I would suppress them sternly '' . 
Moreover , he organized the movement of his forms , within his rigorously shaped space , into highly complex equilibriums ; ; and used gradations of color value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors . 
The worthy Mondrian , seeing these pictures , said in a tone of kindly reproof : `` But you are really an artist of the naturalistic tradition '' ! ! 
Helion did not realize it at the time , but it was true . 
His `` monumental '' abstraction , made up of smooth , metallic `` non-objects '' acting upon each other with great tension , won Helion much acclaim during the 'thirties . 
The play of novel lighting effects also entered into these compositions , whose controlled power and varied activity made them well worth meditating . 
As Helion 's work showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature , the pure abstractionists expressed some disapproval ; ; but Leger , Arp , Lipchitz and Alexander Calder , at the time , gave him their blessing .

the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . 
Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm 's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . 
To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . 
In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing .

a simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by Afj . 
These are real analytic periodic functions with period T . 
In the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares . 
This theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in Afj . 
The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Afj there are families of such cubes . 
Here , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results . 
A square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C . 
Indeed , the spiral Afj , with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses only one inscribed square . 
The square has one corner point on the straight line segment , and does not lie entirely in the interior . 
On C , from the point P at Afj to the point Q at Afj , we construct the chord , and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as S approaches zero the square is inside C . 
As S increases we consider the two free corner points of the square , Afj and Afj , adjacent to P and Q respectively . 
As S approaches T the square will be outside C and therefore both Afj and Afj must cross C an odd number of times as S varies from zero to T . 
The points may also touch C without crossing . 
Suppose Afj crosses C when Afj . 
We now have certain squares with three corners on C .
