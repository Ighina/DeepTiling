She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient . 
The fish took the bait . 
He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but -- joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned . 
But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement . 
She was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed . 
Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose . 
She wrote again and now , abandoning for the moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career . 
She could act and she could write . 
His lordship was concerned in the management of Drury Lane but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and criticize her novel ? ? 
At last he consented to meet her , and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal : Have you any objection to the following plan ? ? 
On Thursday evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles . 
There we shall be free and unknown ; ; we can return the following morning She concluded by asking for a brief interview -- `` to settle with you where '' -- and she threw in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild originality of your countenance '' . 
She opened his reply with trembling fingers he agreed ! ! 
And he would see her that evening . 
Victory at last ! !

artists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . 
To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . 
At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . 
Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . 
And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . 
The storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men 's minds . 
Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself .

a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home was called `` locatin ' '' 'em 'em . 
To keep 'em 'em scattered somewhat and yet herd 'em 'em was called `` loose herdin ' '' . 
To hold 'em 'em in a compact mass was `` close herdin ' '' . 
Cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted . 
That became their `` home range '' . 
Yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out , seekin ' grass and water . 
These became `` strays '' , the term bein ' restricted to cattle , however , as hosses , under like circumstances , were spoken of as `` stray hosses '' , not merely `` strays '' . 
Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over . 
You could n't stop 'em 'em ; ; you had to go with 'em 'em or wait till the storm was over , and follow . 
Such marchin ' in wholesale numbers was called a `` drift '' , or `` winter drift '' , and if the storm was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range .

It usually turned out well for him because either he liked the right people or there were only a few wrong people in the town . 
Alfred wanted to invest in my father 's hotel and advance enough money to build a larger place . 
It was a very tempting offer . 
My father would have done it if it had n't been for my mother , who had a fear of being in debt to anyone -- even Alfred Alpert . 
In spite of his being well liked there were a few people who were very careful about Alfred . 
They had my mother 's opinion of him : that he was too sharp or a little too good to be true . 
One of the people who was afraid of Alfred was his own brother , Lew . 
I do n't know how and I do n't know why but the two stores , the one in Margaretville and the one in Fleischmanns that had been set up as a partnership , were dissolved , separated from each other .

the honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor . 
Occasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all . 
They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . 
I must add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . 
It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather . 
Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . 
The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind . 
Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the red Ribes sanguineum of our Pacific Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins . 
The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble : honeybees , bumblebees , and other wild bees , and also various kinds of flies . 
It is a happy , buzzing crowd . 
Each male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers . 
It is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always arranged in pairs , and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green , black-tipped little scale .

the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room , and then they went across the hall to the kitchen . 
She was intimidated by the stove . 
He found the pilot light and turned on one of the burners for her . 
The gas flamed up two inches high . 
They found the teakettle . 
And put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox . 
Several sections of a loaf of dark bread ; ; butter ; ; jam ; ; a tiny cake of ice . 
In their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast china but the wrong table silver , they opened every cupboard door in the kitchen and pantry . 
While she was settling the teacart , he went back across the hall to their bedroom , opened one of the suitcases , and took out powdered coffee and sugar . 
She appeared with the teacart and he opened the windows . 
`` Do you want to call Eugene '' ? ?

Biological warfare Biological warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man . 
It is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems . 
Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals . 
Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon . 
The major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect . 
The incubation period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter . 
A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases . 
Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities . 
An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area . 
This concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of particulate biological materials , the pathogenesis of respiratory infections , the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence . 
The biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years . 
Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics . 
Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assesment techniques . 
Much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures . 
The intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organisms .

A year ago it was bruited that the primary character in Erich Maria Remarque 's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso De Portago , the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia automobile race of 1957 . 
If this was in fact Mr. Remarque 's intention he has achieved a notable failure . 
Clerfayt of `` Heaven Has No Favorites '' resembles Portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver , whereas Portago was a good one . 
He is a dull , unformed , and aimless person ; ; the twelfth Marquis De Portago was intelligent , purposeful , and passionate . 
One looked forward to Mr. Remarque 's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing , as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised . 
Unhappily , `` Heaven Has No Favorites '' does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list . 
Mr. Remarque 's conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble . 
He proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery . 
His treatment of it is something else . 
His heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery , years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium , being higher than she wishes to pay . 
Her lover precedes her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has chosen . 
Between the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement , Mr. Remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse , some demure and rather fetching love-making , pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe , and a modicum of automobile racing . 
The ramblings on life , death , and the wonder of it all are distressing ; ; the love-making , perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness , is often charming ; ; the automobile racing bears little relation to reality . 
This latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn Clerfayt as , say , a tournament golfer .

Mando , pleading her cause , must have said that Dr. Brown was the most distinguished physician in the United States of America , for our man poured out his symptoms and drew a madly waving line indicating the irregularity of his pulse . 
`` He 's got high blood pressure , too , and bum kidneys '' , the doctor said to me . 
`` Transparent look , waxy skin -- could well be uremia '' . 
He looked disapprovingly at an ash tray piled high with cigarette stubs , shook his head , and moved his hand back and forth in a strong negative gesture . 
The little official hung his head in shame .

Some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , Victorian past ; ; that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation . 
Perhaps -- but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners , family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance . 
Joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women . 
Various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both . 
Privacy must be highly assured both in time and place . 
That is , locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment .
