==========
the last years of Woodrow Wilson 's administration , a red scare developed in our country . 
Many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force . 
Postmaster General Burleson set about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails . 
Attorney General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more than 4,000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights . 
Then , not many years later , the Un-American Activities Committee , under the leadership of Martin Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens . 
Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government . 
This hysteria reached its height under the leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy . 
Demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions . 
New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how . 
Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency . 
They give strict interpretation to William James ' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself '' . 
They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new .

Purification of the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E.F. Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems . 
( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . 
The proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Afj in Afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with Afj . 
The precipitate was washed twice with an 80 % saturated solution of Afj , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen . 
( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) . 
( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Afj potassium phosphate and Afj . 
Preparation of frozen sections The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al ( 1951 ) . 
Root and stem tumors from sweet clover plants infected with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen , embedded in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 \*\* ym in a cryostat maintained at -16-degrees to -20-degrees . 
The sections were mounted on cold slides smeared with Haupts ' adhesive ( Johansen , 1940 ) in earlier experiments , and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components reported by Schramm and Rottger ( 1959 ) . 
The latter adhesive was found to be much more satisfactory . 
The sections were then thawed by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a fan for 30 minutes ; ; until used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks . 
Staining technique indirect method . 
The sections were fixed in acetone for 15 minutes and dried at 37-degrees for 30 minutes .

the less developed countries , however , such programing is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent . 
Only a very few of the more advanced ones , such as India and Pakistan , have developed systematic techniques of programing . 
Others have so-called development plans , but some of these are little more than lists of projects collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals without analysis of the actions required to attain them . 
Only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation . 
We can help in the planning process . 
Neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country ; ; it must express the nation 's own will and goal . 
Nevertheless , we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing . 
First , we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs . 
Second , we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on the consistency of such projects with the program . 
Third , we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the country 's objectives and resources . 
This includes assistance in -- assembling the basic economic , financial , technological , and educational information on which programing depends ; ; surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy , such as transport , agriculture , communication , industry , and power ; ; designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation ; ; and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established . 
We must use common sense in applying conditions .

The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion . 
The architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . 
Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education . 
It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more .

The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky . 
The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no more . 
The things left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows . 
Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and then empty of images . 
They slept -- Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring , the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table . 
In the ballroom below , the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows . 
It was a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky . 
Martha Schuyler , old , slow , careful of foot , came down the great staircase , dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk , her jeweled shoe buckles held forward . 
`` Well , I 'm here at last '' , she said , addressing the old portraits on the walls .

It was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began . 
The rider from Concord was as good as his word . 
He came spurring and whooping down the road , his horse kicking up clouds of dust , shouting : `` They 're a-coming ! ! 
By God , they 're a-coming , they are '' ! ! 
We heard him before he ever showed , and we heard him yelling after he was out of sight . 
Solomon Chandler had n't misjudged the strength of his lungs , not at all .

This should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) . 
For galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste . 
This could also be used for any other skin irritation .

The person who left the buggy there has never been identified . 
It was a busy street , conveniently near the shopping center , and unattended horses and wagons were often left at the curbside . 
There are , of course , many weaknesses in any case against Emma . 
She did n't like her stepmother , but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage . 
She had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed . 
She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels . 
If she avoided the train and hired a buggy , the stableman might have recognized her . 
If police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated , she would be completely eliminated as a suspect .

Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at Hunter College that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints . 
Still a demurrer or two must be entered . 
Schwarzkopf is , of course , Schwarzkopf . 
For style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her . 
If the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be , it is still a beautiful instrument , controlled and flexible . 
Put to the service of lieder of Schubert , Brahms , Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way , it made its effect with ease and precision . 
But what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism . 
Instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside . 
The symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable . 
Clever light songs were overly coy , tragic songs a little too melodramatic . 
There was an extra pause here , a gasp or a sigh there , here and there an extra little twist of a word or note , all in the interest of effect . 
The result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness . 
There were stunning musical phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication . 
Miss Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist , John Wustman , often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition . 
All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills ; ; Miss Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them .
