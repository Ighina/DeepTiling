what the many feed additives can do and how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef , dairy , and sheep men . 
The target chart quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what . 
All the additives listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration of the federal government . 
All comments concerning effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with Afj . 
This article assumes that the rations you are feeding your beef , dairy cattle , and sheep are adequately balanced with protein , vitamins , and minerals . 
The drug 's chemical name is listed , since most states require feed processors to use this name instead of the trade name on the feed tag . 
In some instances , the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical name . 
This indicates that this drug is being marketed under one trade name only or state regulatory organizations have approved its use on the feed tag . 
Here 's your feed additive guide for ruminants : drug 's chemical name : Oxytetracycline hydrochloride ( Terramycin ) what it does : Increases rate of gain and improves feed efficiency , aids in the prevention or treatment ( depending on level fed ) of the early stages of shipping fever , prevents or treats bacterial diarrhea , and aids in reducing incidence of bloat and liver abscesses . 
Milk production may be increased by the anti-infective properties of this drug . 
How to feed : beef cattle ( finishing ration ) -- To increase rate of gain and improve feed efficiency , feed 75 milligrams per head in daily supplement .

These societies can expect to face difficult times . 
As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction . 
National leaders will have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men 's sense of identity . 
Feelings of a community of interest will have to be recreated -- in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for the first time -- on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past . 
Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped . 
The United States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . 
Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face . 
At the same time , we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts . 
It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable tasks at home .

The recent experiments in the new poetry-and-jazz movement seen by some as part of the `` San Francisco Renaissance '' have been as popular as they are notorious . 
`` It might well start a craze like swallowing goldfish or pee-wee golf '' , wrote Kenneth Rexroth in an explanatory note in the Evergreen Review , and he may have been right . 
Under the general heading `` poetry-and-jazz '' widely divergent experiments have been carried out . 
Lawrence Ferlenghetti and Bruce Lippincott have concentrated on writing a new poetry for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical forms of jazz , and the vocabulary of the musician . 
Even musicians themselves have taken to writing poetry . 
( Judy Tristano now has poems as well as ballads written for her . 
) But the best known exploiters of the new medium are Kenneth Rexroth and Kenneth Patchen . 
Rexroth and Patchen are far apart musically and poetically in their experiments . 
Rexroth is a longtime jazz buff , a name-dropper of jazz heroes , and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz . 
In San Francisco he has worked with Brew Moore , Charlie Mingus , and other `` swinging '' musicians of secure reputation , thus placing himself within established jazz traditions , in addition to being a part of the San Francisco `` School '' . 
Although Patchen has given previous evidence of an interest in jazz , the musical group that he works with , the Chamber Jazz Sextet , is often ignored by jazz critics . 
( Downbeat did not mention the Los Angeles appearance of Patchen and the Sextet , although the engagement lasted over two months .

Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel . 
He had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order , but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonel 's belt . 
Despite his yearning , the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines . 
He would remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task . 
-- Beckworth . 
-- Sir ? ? 
-- Fetch me the copies of everything B and C companies have requisitioned in the last six months . 
-- The last six months , sir ? ? 
-- You heard me .

Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits ; ; they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities . 
Their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes , but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe . 
Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power . 
Thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors . 
But this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities . 
Since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living . 
The royal ritual generated power into the other world : it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world . 
Proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world ; ; but naturally , the royal ritual , which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits , was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom . 
This is the familiar system of `` cosmic government '' . 
The Chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers .

itself in the sands of the 19th Century , the grand stream of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi frescos of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington . 
The artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution , and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find . 
But it is a great conception . 
The open ceiling , with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky : the closed frieze , formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls , belong in their large ordering to the line of Correggio and his Baroque followers . 
The descent may be remote , but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the United States . 
Constantino Brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole , in collaboration with the architect Charles U. Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure . 
After many years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco , and slightly less than half the frieze , beginning with the Liberty group opposite the East door , and ending with William Penn , all but one leg , when a tragic accident ended his career .

A little farther along the road you come to the Church of Santa Sabina , called the `` Pearl of the Aventine '' . 
Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the Knights of Malta . 
On the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments . 
The massive gate of the Maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in Rome . 
If you look through the keyhole , you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of St. Peter 's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees . 
Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via Di Santa Sabina and turn right on the Via Di S. Alessio , a street lined with stately homes . 
Oleanders , cypress , and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section . 
Turn left a block or so before the street ends , and then turn right down the Via Di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino . 
Here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city . 
The renaissance city to the piazza Navona and pantheon These two walks take you through the heart of Rome . 
You will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi . 
You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed , a magnificent square , the main shopping district , the Spanish Steps , and the lovely Pincian Gardens . 
By seeing such varied places , both interesting and beautiful , you will become aware of the many different civilizations Rome has lived through , and in particular , get a feel of Renaissance Rome .

capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue . 
The directors sold directly to concessionaires , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company . 
These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers . 
The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to France in company ships . 
The company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show . 
In accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians . 
The lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade of New France and Louisiana in the previous century , and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men . 
Traders from the English colonies were far more generous , and Indian loyalty turned to them . 
Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company . 
In 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony . 
They ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts . 
They adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts . 
In each of these there was to be a strong military post , and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses .

There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement . 
You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before . 
I ca n't tell when , but I 'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! ! 
This experience will have happened to many of you . 
Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' . 
Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences . 
In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually . 
When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja vue , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar . 
Occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which can not be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude . 
One day Maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified . 
Rudyard Kipling 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ? ?

Two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time . 
One , a reservation on the point I have just made , is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking , pseudo-feeling , and pseudo-willing , which Fromm discussed in The Escape From Freedom . 
In essence this involves grounding one 's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather than in one 's own values and experience . 
There is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else . 
Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important . 
Moreover , if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking ; ; if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity . 
The second timely part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products of today . 
In the range and variety of characters who , in their literary lives , get along all right with life styles one never imagined possible , there is an implicit lesson in differentiation . 
The reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ? ? 
And find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species . 
The observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be , like the models he sees , even more like everybody else . 
And this , I think , holds for values as well as life styles .
