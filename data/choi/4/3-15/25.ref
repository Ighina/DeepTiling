These societies can expect to face difficult times . 
As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction . 
National leaders will have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men 's sense of identity . 
Feelings of a community of interest will have to be recreated -- in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for the first time -- on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past . 
Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped . 
The United States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . 
Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face . 
At the same time , we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts . 
It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable tasks at home . 
We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene . 
When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development . 
As a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; ; but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world community . 
Transitional societies When we look at countries like Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , and Burma , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital , and where institutions of centralized government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy .

Rhode Island Heritage Week proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , governor The theme of Rhode Island Heritage Week for 1961 will be `` Independence and Union '' . 
It commemorates the 185th anniversary of Rhode Island 's Independence when , upon May 4 , 1776 , the General Assembly , by its action , established the first free republic in the New World . 
As this year marks the centennial of the beginning of the Civil War , this fact is being commemorated with several exhibits throughout the State , but most of all paying tribute to the first Rhode Island Volunteers who rushed to the defense of the City of Washington , putting at the disposal of President Lincoln the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time . 
On April 30 , ceremonies commemorating the departure of these volunteers will take place at 1:00 P.M. at the Dexter Training Grounds in Providence . 
The Independence Day celebration will be properly observed with a big military and civic parade from West Warwick to the Greene Homestead in Anthony ; ; and now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of april 29th to may 7th , 1961 , as Rhode Island Heritage Week , advising our citizens that throughout this week many historic houses and beautiful gardens will be open to visitors as well as industrial plants , craft shops , museums and libraries and I earnestly urge all to take advantage of these opportunities to see as many of these places as they can during this outstanding week . 
In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 21st day of April , in the year of Our Lord , one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and on Independence , the one hundred and eighty-fifth . 
Governor Armed Forces Day Proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor The year 1961 marks the fourteenth anniversary of the unification of our Armed Forces under the National Security Act of 1947 . 
National defense , like the continuing search for peace with freedom and justice for all , is `` everybody 's business '' . 
Our investment in this effort , the greatest in our Nation 's history , reflects our determination to ensure the peace and the future of freedom . 
It is a sound investment . 
As the President has said , `` only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain that they will never be employed '' . 
Armed Forces Day is the annual report on this investment , a public presentation designed to give our own people , and the people of other lands who stand with us for peace with freedom and justice , the best possible opportunity to see and understand what we have and why we have it .

atmospheric tests One of the inescapable realities of the Cold War is that it has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas . 
The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself . 
That dilemma is as much with us as ever . 
The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of Soviet tests . 
When this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late '50's -- the United States appeared to have three choices . 
It could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations . 
It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist world domination . 
Or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security . 
This third choice was in fact made . 
With the resumption of Soviet testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken . 
Once again , the United States must choose . 
And once again , the choices are much the same . 
Only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder . 
The first choice , abandoning tests entirely , would not only be unpopular domestically , but would surely be exploited by the Russians .

emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . 
In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . 
Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . 
Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . 
A previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . 
It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . 
In addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates . 
But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex . 
MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions .

A former Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about maximizing Du Pont 's share of the General Motors market . 
Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were actively promoted . 
Within a few years various Du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General Motors ' eight operating divisions . 
The Fisher Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from Du Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General Motors divisions . 
Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend stemmed `` at least in part '' from the needs of General Motors outstripping Du Pont 's capacity . 
`` The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of Du Pont 's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest . 
The inference is overwhelming that Du Pont 's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit '' . 
353 U.S. , at 605 . 
This Court agreed with the trial court `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not overlooked by either Du Pont or General Motors '' . 
353 U.S. , at 606 . 
However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including Du Pont 's competitors '' , outweighed the Government 's claim for relief . 
This claim , as submitted to the District Court and dismissed by it , 126 F.Supp.235 , alleged violation not only of 7 of the Clayton Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act . 
The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . 
However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman Act allegations .

Hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never maintained that sex was all . 
Hemingway 's fiction is supported by a `` moral '' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension . 
And D.H. Lawrence , in Fantasia Of The Unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive . 
Though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex . 
`` All is not sex '' , declared Lawrence . 
Man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy . 
The creative urge , for example , transcends the body and the self . 
But for the beat generation all is sex .

The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts in the 1960 Olympics for one reason -- they were better . 
They were better trained , better looking , better built , better disciplined and something else -- they were better dancers . 
Our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance . 
The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics . 
But why gymnastics at all ? ? 
And is the sport really important ? ?

I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them . 
If they were , Walter Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky , and Herb Lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about . 
I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions . 
Assumption 1 . 
The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity ; ; and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United States . 
I speak of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved -- ever -- reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around . 
Assumption 2 .

the term of service in Japan , each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community . 
The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support for this program . 
Musical activities the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life . 
Extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining , under skilled direction , the Choir , the Orchestra , the Band , the Glee Club , and smaller ensembles of wind and string players . 
All students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they qualify . 
Orchestra , Band , and Choir have auditions during the week preceding the first day of classes . 
The Glee Club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership . 
In addition to the many appearances of these organizations throughout the college year , there are concerts by students of the music department , by members of the music faculty , and by visiting artists . 
Student musical organizations are the Knights of Carleton and the Overtones ( men 's vocal groups ) , and the Keynotes ( a women 's singing group ) . 
These student-directed organizations include eight to ten members each ; ; they perform at many campus social events . 
Religious activities from the founding of the College those responsible for its management have planned to provide its students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding the meaning and importance of religion . 
Courses are offered in ethics , the philosophy and history of religion , Christian thought and history , and the Bible . 
Carleton aims throughout its entire teaching program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious development of its students . 
A college service of worship is held each Sunday morning at eleven o'clock in the Chapel .
