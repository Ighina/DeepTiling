City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city . 
Estimates of the city 's loss in the $ 344,000 job have ranged as high as $ 200,000 . 
Shortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors . 
The Hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said . 
The Controller 's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : The city has sued for the full amount of the $ 172,400 performance bond covering the contract . 
The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project . 
The signature of Harold V. Varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project . 
Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor . 
Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter . 
The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959 . 
Concern bankrupt The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries , Inc. , both of 3646 N. 2d St. , filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law . 
On Monday , the Hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization . 
Business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District Attorney James C. Crumlish , Jr .. Intervenes in case The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms . 
Travelers Indemnity Co. and the Continental Casualty Co .. At Berger 's direction , the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U.S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there . 
`` I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated '' , Berger said .

atmospheric tests One of the inescapable realities of the Cold War is that it has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas . 
The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself . 
That dilemma is as much with us as ever . 
The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of Soviet tests . 
When this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late '50's -- the United States appeared to have three choices . 
It could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations . 
It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist world domination . 
Or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security . 
This third choice was in fact made . 
With the resumption of Soviet testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken .

Wage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . 
The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries . 
While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2 . 
Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented . 
The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny .

He remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of the final , desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy . 
When the victory cheer went up this officer found himself still mounted , with his horse pressed broadside against Cleburne 's log parapet in a tangled group of infantrymen . 
His hat was gone , the tears were streaming from his eyes . 
He never knew how he got there . 
Six climactic minutes in an individual 's life left no memory . 
Eight hundred and sixty-five Rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day . 
Eight field guns were captured in position .

the Dominican Republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be due in large part to the U.S. show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship . 
Outwardly , Ciudad Trujillo is calm . 
None of the Trujillo family remains .

It was not until we had returned to the city to live , while I was still at Brown and Sharpe 's , that I felt the full impact of evangelical Christianity . 
I came under the spell of a younger group in the church led by the pastor 's older son . 
The spirit of this group was that we were -- and are -- living in a world doomed to eternal punishment , but that God through Jesus Christ has provided a way of escape for those who confess their sins and accept salvation . 
There are millions who accept this doctrine , but few indeed are those who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lies as a weight on their souls night and day . 
This group in Park Place Church was made up of the earnest few . 
I was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns and responsibilities . 
I engaged more and more in religious activities . 
Besides Church and Sunday School I went to out-of-door meetings on the sidewalk at the church door . 
I went to an afternoon service at the Afj . 
I went to the Christian Endeavor Society and to the evening service of the church . 
Much of this lacked the active support of the pastor . 
The young people were self-energizing , and I was energized . 
Once or twice my father asked me if I was n't overdoing a bit in my churchgoing . 
Meanwhile I myself was not yet saved . 
At least I had been unable to lay hold on the experience of conversion .

Ireland 's County Limerick , near the River Shannon , there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen , which means `` Garden of Owen '' . 
Undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on American military history , or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name . 
The cry `` Garryowen '' ! ! 
Bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes , Sioux and Apaches , Mexican banditos under Pancho Villa , Japanese in the South Pacific , and Chinese and North Korean Communists in Korea .
