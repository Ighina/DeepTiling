meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters . 
Since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential aide , one person , with adequate staff assistance , could fill both jobs . 
Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals rather than as employees , enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course . 
The faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship . 
The president expects faculty members to remember , in exercising their autonomy , that they share no collective responsibility for the university 's income nor are they personally accountable for top-level decisions . 
He may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy , but he has a right to expect , in return , that they will leave administrative matters to the administration .

She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient . 
The fish took the bait . 
He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but -- joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned . 
But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement . 
She was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed . 
Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose . 
She wrote again and now , abandoning for the moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career .

Two metabolites ( 1 , and 2 ) ) of p-aminobenzoic acid ( PABA ) which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast bacteria are biosynthesized from Afj . 
The 7 carbons of PABA are incorporated directly into metabolite 2 ( ( as shown with both ring-labeled and carboxy-labeled Afj ) . 
Thirty-five of the 36 carbon atoms arise from Afj .

What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ? ? 
Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? ? 
Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? ? 
Will the danger increase or decrease ? ? 
I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon , in the White House , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` Sherwood Forest '' .

The farmer 's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock . 
Livestock must be tended every day , routinely . 
A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens . 
Even if there are no livestock , the farmer can not leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season . 
The worker who lives on a farm can not change jobs readily . 
He can not leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ; ; such a move may mean a loss of capital . 
Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life . 
The farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night . 
Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain . 
No matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up . 
It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably . 
Production may fall far below expectations . 
Drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops . 
Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner 's earnings , even into his capital .

This broad delegation leaves within our discretion ( subject to the always-present criterion of the public interest ) both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive , and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided . 
3 . 
The present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast ( AM ) band , from 540 kc. to 1600 kc .. Whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies , each interferes to some extent with reception of the other . 
The extent of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal , or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors , among the principal ones being the distance between the stations , their respective radiated power , and , of particular significance here , the time of day . 
Other factors playing a part in the extent of AM service and interference are the frequency involved , the time of year , the position of the year in the sunspot cycle , ground conductivity along the transmission path , atmospheric and manmade noise , and others . 
With the existence of these many factors , some of them variable , it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments of AM stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances . 
Rather , such assignments are made , as they must be , on the basis of certain overall rules and standards , representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem , taking into account for each situation some of the variables ( e.g. , power and station separations ) and averaging out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation . 
An example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable . 
By this standard , it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved , objectionable interference from station A exists at any point within the service area of station B where station A 's signal is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station B 's signal at that point .

I stood on a table , surrounded by hundreds of expectant young faces . 
Questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship activities . 
After making a short statement about human rights , and the freedom to travel , I told them I would be going to the Kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the Rhine into Germany . 
`` May we come with you '' ? ? 
Called out a dozen young voices . 
`` Well , I might not get that far '' , I told them , `` as actually I have no papers to enter Germany and , as a matter of fact , no permit to return to France once I leave '' . 
That was all they needed . 
They would champion me . 
We would all meet at ten o'clock at the Kehl bridge , five miles from Strasbourg , and march triumphantly across into Germany . 
There was only one hitch : the small town of Kehl , on the other side of the Rhine , was still under French jurisdiction .

The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . 
An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . 
There are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . 
For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . 
For the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . 
The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 . 
The essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman . 
He recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process , the remaining stages must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process . 
Moreover , by systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal Af-stage policy for the remaining stages , we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all R stages . 
Proceeding in this way , from one to two and from two to three stages , we may gradually build up the policy for any number . 
At each step of the calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied . 
To see how important this economy is , let us suppose that there are M operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by N variables ; ; then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operations of order Afj ( where a is some number not unreasonably large ) .

downstairs with the tray , Winston wished he could have given in to Miss Ada , but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that little-girl look . 
There were times it was n't right to make a person happy , like the times she came in the kitchen and asked know we do n't keep peanut `` butter for a peanut butter sandwich .

`` Why , Winston '' , she 'd cry , `` I just now saw you eating it out of the jar '' ! !

Austin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel 's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . 
Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . 
Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . 
But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . 
Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . 
He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic '' . 
It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . 
The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . 
The escheat law can not be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . 
Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . 
`` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . 
`` You take out of circulation many millions of dollars '' . 
Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies '' . 
His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J.B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin .
