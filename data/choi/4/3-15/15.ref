A year ago it was bruited that the primary character in Erich Maria Remarque 's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso De Portago , the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia automobile race of 1957 . 
If this was in fact Mr. Remarque 's intention he has achieved a notable failure . 
Clerfayt of `` Heaven Has No Favorites '' resembles Portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver , whereas Portago was a good one . 
He is a dull , unformed , and aimless person ; ; the twelfth Marquis De Portago was intelligent , purposeful , and passionate . 
One looked forward to Mr. Remarque 's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing , as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised . 
Unhappily , `` Heaven Has No Favorites '' does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list . 
Mr. Remarque 's conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble . 
He proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery . 
His treatment of it is something else . 
His heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery , years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium , being higher than she wishes to pay . 
Her lover precedes her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has chosen .

They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury 's expense . 
They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if it were the source of such reports . 
Few things are more perilous for the State Department than a displeased congressman . 
The reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are so available . 
First , the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters . 
The farmers may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department 's budget . 
Businessmen will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department . 
Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department ; ; the Chamber of Commerce , assaults upon the Treasury . 
A kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . 
The congressman 's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense Department . 
Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every voter who can write . 
With all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly . 
No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the State Department in anger . 
In many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson .

the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . 
Several factors contributed to this change . 
The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . 
Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . 
Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . 
International law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . 
Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared . 
In both respects , international law was Europeanized . 
It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions . 
On the one hand , the major European nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality -- thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience . 
But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world . 
Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere . 
Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin America ( though limited in Latin America by the special interest of the United States as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine , itself from the outset related to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance of power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the European `` balance '' itself . 
A nation such as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect its neutrality ; ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin American countries ; ; out of the question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa . 
This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19th century scholars .

Local industry 's investment in Rhode Island was the big story in 1960 's industrial development effort . 
Fifty-two companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction , totaling 1,418,000 square feet and representing an investment of $ 11,900,000 ; ; a new post-World War 2 , record . 
With minor exceptions , this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here . 
What made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation , Rhode Island scored marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs . 
Of the major expansions in 1960 , three were financed under the R/NP.I. Industrial Building Authority 's 100 % guaranteed mortgage plan : Collyer Wire , Leesona Corporation , and American Tube & Controls . 
Leading firms that arranged their own financing included Speidel Corporation , Cornell-Dubilier , Photek , Inc . 
Division of Textron , Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry , W.R. Cobb Company , and Mays Manufacturing Company .

Philadelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . 
Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 a year . 
He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . 
The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw 's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer .

Murray Louis and his dance company appeared at the Henry Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work , `` Signal '' , and the repetition of an earlier one , `` Journal '' . 
`` Signal '' is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais . 
Its abstract decor is by John Hultberg . 
Program note reads as follows : `` Take hands ; ; this urgent visage beckons us '' . 
Here , as in `` Journal '' , Mr. Louis has given himself the lion 's share of the dancing , and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements . 
Indeed , both `` Journal '' and `` Signal '' qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics . 
But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative , and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing . 
One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect , there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development . 
It may be , of course , that Mr. Louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation . 
But it may be , also , that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time . 
One thing is certain , however , and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents , phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be . 
' an American journey ' A brisk , satirical spoof of contemporary American mores entitled `` An American Journey '' was given its first New York performance at Hunter College Playhouse last night by the Helen Tamiris-Daniel Nagrin Dance Company . 
Choreographed by Mr. Nagrin , the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first New York showing of Miss Tamiris ' `` Once Upon A Time '' as well as her `` Women 's Song '' and Mr. Nagrin 's `` Indeterminate Figure '' . 
Eugene Lester assembled a witty and explicit score for `` An American Journey '' , and Malcolm McCormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes .

us see just how typical Krim is . 
He is New York-born and Jewish . 
He spent one year at the University of North Carolina because Thomas Wolfe went there . 
He returned to New York to work for The New Yorker , to edit a Western pulp , to `` duck the war in the OWI '' , to write publicity for Paramount Pictures and commentary for a newsreel , then he began his career as critic for various magazines . 
Now he has abandoned all that to be A Writer . 
I do not want to quibble about typicality ; ; in a certain sense , one manner of experience will be typical of any given group while another will not . 
But I 've got news for Krim : he 's not typical , he 's pretty special . 
His may typify a certain kind of postwar New York experience , but his experience is certainly not typical of his `` generation 's '' .

She was just another freighter from the States , and she seemed as commonplace as her name . 
She was the John Harvey , one of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the U.S. Fifteenth Air Force , to Field Marshal Montgomery 's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of Italy in that early December of 1943 . 
The John Harvey arrived in Bari , a port on the Adriatic , on November 28th , making for Porto Nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city 's new and modern harbor . 
Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole . 
If anyone thought of the John Harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried . 
Which was poison gas . 
It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront .

A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants , which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise . 
This theory eventually proved inexact . 
But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science . 
It is the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors . 
These keys are the working principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolated , or projected , to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge . 
In the autumn of 1959 , the British Broadcasting Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology . 
Three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator . 
The participants were Professor H. Bondi , professor of mathematics at King 's College , London ; ; Dr. W.B. Bonnor , reader in mathematics at Queen Elizabeth College , London ; ; Dr. R/NP.A. Lyttleton , a lecturer at St. John 's College , Cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of Cambridge ; ; and Dr. G.J. Whitrow , reader in applied mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology , London . 
Dr. Whitrow functioned as moderator . 
The programs were so well received by the British public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called , `` Rival Theories Of Cosmology '' . 
Dr. Bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe , based on the general theory of relativity . 
First of all , and this has been calculated by observation , the universe is expanding -- that is , the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds .

The design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement . 
In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves . 
The main set of bars are the `` tappets '' and one tappet is connected to each lever . 
If the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time . 
Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars .
