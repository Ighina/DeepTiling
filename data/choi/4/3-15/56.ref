him become honest , and they discard him . 
-- But let him be ready to invent whatever falsehood -- to assail whatever character -- and to prostitute his paper to whatever ends -- and they hug him to their heart . 
In proportion to the degradation of his moral worth , is the increase of his worth to them '' . 
To exonerate the legislature and thereby extricate himself from a sticky situation , Pike took another course and made it appear that the legislature had been bilked . 
He claimed in his attacks that Woodruff , with scurrilous underhandedness , had deliberately written an ambiguous bid that had so confused the honest members of the legislature that they had awarded him the contract without knowing what they were doing . 
The charge was so farfetched that Woodruff paid little attention to it , and answered Pike in a rather bored way , wearily declaring that a `` new hand '' was pumping the bellows of the Crittenden organ , and concluding : `` In a controversy with an adversary so utterly destitute of moral principles , even a triumph would entitle the victor to no laurels . 
The game is not worth the ammunition it would cost . 
We therefore leave the writer to the enjoyment of the unenvied reputation which the personal abuse he has heaped on us will entitle him to from the low and vulgar herd to which he belongs '' . 
Despite Woodruff 's continuing refusal to debate with Pike through the columns of his newspaper , Pike did not let up his attack for a moment . 
Over the months he became a political gadfly with an incessant barrage of satirical poems ridiculing Woodruff , the `` Casca '' letters belittling Woodruff , and long analytical articles vilifying Woodruff . 
So persistent were these attacks that in March of the following year , Woodruff was finally moved to action , and Pike was to learn his first lesson in frontier politics , the subtle art of diversion . 
To attack Pike directly would gain Woodruff little , for as a penniless newcomer Pike had nothing to lose . 
By this time Woodruff had accurately measured Pike as a man of great personal pride , a man who would fly into a towering rage if his integrity were questioned , and who would be anxious to avenge himself .

He was in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing . 
There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; ; it was always the same unqualified success now . 
He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values . 
Stowey Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality . 
He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; ; he rose at half-past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop . 
This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist . 
The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor . 
His files , desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos . 
Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac . 
Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house .

the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . 
B. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . 
However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . 
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . 
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . 
In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . 
If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . 
It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue .

the Dominican Republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be due in large part to the U.S. show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship . 
Outwardly , Ciudad Trujillo is calm . 
None of the Trujillo family remains . 
Mr. Balaguer is in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring . 
Had U.S. warships not appeared off the Dominican coast , there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war . 
Ultimately either the Trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro in Cuba . 
Within the Organization of American States , there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention which was not without risk obviously . 
But there was no complaint from the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad Trujillo 's waterfront shouting , `` Vive Yankees '' ! ! 
More , the U.S. action was hailed by a principal opposition leader , Dr. Juan Bosch , as having saved `` many lives and many troubles in the near future '' .

Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre . 
Most avant-garde creators , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting . 
But Robert Rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them . 
He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham 's Summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity . 
For Mr. Taylor 's Images And Reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl 's cape lined with grass . 
Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor . 
In fact , he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound . 
To raise the dancer out of his personal , pedestrian self , Mr. Nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger , environmental orbit . 
He began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be . 
He went on to use objects -- hoops , poles , capes -- which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer , who moved with them . 
The depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure . 
In each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer .

a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed . 
Just what is meant by `` spirit '' and by `` matter '' ? ? 
The terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all . 
Yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do . 
For in the modern world neither `` spirit '' nor `` matter '' refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience . 
We are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected . 
When the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind , or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours .

April 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three-masted bark , Discovery , weighed anchor in St. Katherine 's Pool , London , and floated down the Thames toward the sea . 
She carried , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America . 
Seventeen months later , on September 6 , 1611 , an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay . 
When she reached port , she was found to have on board only eight men , all near starvation . 
The captain was gone , and the mate was gone . 
The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman . 
What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months ? ? 
What happened to the fourteen missing men ? ? 
These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time . 
For hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain 's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man 's desk on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports . 
All told , they offered a highly confused picture . 
But since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information . 
Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage . 
Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations .

fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals . 
Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melting grease . 
Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat . 
Do n't/RB forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces . 
Clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly . 
Do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit . 
Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables , sauces and such . 
Do n't/RB fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops . 
Sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results . 
Do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them . 
If doubtful about a steak , boldly cut it in half . 
If necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra time .

Pope Leo 13 , on the 13th day of December 1898 , granted the following indulgences : `` An indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the Faithful who read the Holy Gospels at least a quarter of an hour . 
A Plenary Indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading '' . 
Pope Pius the Sixth , at Rome , in April , 1778 , wrote the following : `` The faithful should be excited to the reading of the Holy Scriptures : For these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone , to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine , to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times '' . 
The American Bishops assembled at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore urged the Catholic people to read the Holy Bible . 
`` We hope '' , they said , `` that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the Holy Scriptures '' . 
They recommended , also , that `` at a fixed hour , let the entire family be assembled for night prayers , followed by a short reading of the Holy Scriptures '' . 
Since the Catholic Church expresses such desire that the Sacred Scriptures be read , the following taken from the Holy Bible ( New Catholic Edition ) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing . 
The need of the new birth Do not wonder that I said to thee , `` You must be born again '' .

The lyric beauties of Schubert 's Trout Quintet -- its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners . 
But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems . 
Since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass , an instrument generally regarded as symphonic . 
Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . 
The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing . 
Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein . 
Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation . 
In these readings , the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown 's attire -- the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop .
