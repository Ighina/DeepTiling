There are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . 
Mollusks are a case in point . 
The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . 
Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . 
There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . 
The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that .

Harold Arlen returned to California in the winter of 1944 , it was to take up again a collaboration with Johnny Mercer , begun some years before . 
The film they did after his return was an inconsequential bit of nothing titled Out Of This World , a satire on the Sinatra bobby-soxer craze . 
The twist lay in using Bing Crosby 's voice on the sound track while leading man Eddie Bracken mouthed the words . 
If nothing else , at least two good songs came out of the project , `` Out Of This World '' and `` June Comes Around Every Year '' . 
Though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs , Arlen and Mercer were not given strong material to work on . 
Their first collaboration came close .

Livery stable -- J. Vernon , prop . 
'' . 
Coaching had declined considerably by 1905 , but the sign was still there , near the old Wells Fargo building in San Francisco , creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years . 
John Vernon had had all the patronage he cared for -- he had prospered , but he could not retire from horsedom . 
Coaching was in his blood . 
He had two interests in life : the pleasures of the table and driving . 
Twice a week he drove his tallyho over the Santa Cruz road , upland and through the redwood forest , with orchards below him at one hand , and glimpses of the Pacific at the other . 
The journey back he made along the coast road , traveling hell-for-leather , every lantern of the tallyho ablaze . 
The southward route was the classic run in California , and the most fashionable . 
His patronage on this stretch was made up largely of San Franciscans -- regulars , most of them , and trenchermen like himself . 
They did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco .

Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . 
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . 
Siebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . 
Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . 
A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . 
House throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . 
Catcher Frank House 's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . 
Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run . 
Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A 's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani 's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair 's glove into center . 
The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers . 
Three were doubles , Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one . 
Hartman impressive Bill Kunkel , Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium . 
The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth . 
Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph .

This time he was making no mistake . 
Olgivanna -- in her country the nickname was a respectful form of address -- was not only attractive but shrewd , durable , sensible , and smart . 
No wonder Wright was enchanted -- no two better suited people ever met .

the shelter of the tent -- a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped , no longer drumming -- Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid across two beer barrels . 
There was , of course , no real need to rearrange everything . 
A quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake , or the toffee , or the barley sugar , or the sardines , or the bitters , or the condensed milk , or the stationery , or the needles -- what could it mean ? ? 
Adam watched his own hands make the caressing , anxious movement that , when rain falls and nobody comes , and ruin draws close like a cat rubbing against the ankles , has been the ritual of stall vendors , forever . 
He recognized the gesture . 
He knew its meaning . 
He had seen a dry , old , yellowing hand reach out , with that painful solicitude , to touch , to rearrange , to shift aimlessly , some object worth a pfennig . 
Back in Bavaria he had seen that gesture , and at that sight his heart had always died within him . 
On such occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand , whatever face it might be . 
Now the face was his own . 
He wondered what expression , as he made that gesture , was on his face . 
He wondered if it wore the old anxiety , or the old , taut stoicism . 
But there was no need , he remembered , for his hand to reach out , for his face to show concern or stoicism .

Broadway the unoriginals To write a play , the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it . 
Nowadays , more and more , all he needs is someone else 's book . 
To get started , he does not scan the world about him ; ; he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists . 
So far this season , Broadway 's premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original American stage plays .

We often say of a person that he `` looks young for his age '' or `` old for his age '' . 
Yet even in the more extreme of such cases we seldom go very far astray in guessing what his age actually is . 
And this means , I suppose , that almost invariably age reveals itself by easily recognizable signs engraved on both the body and the mind . 
`` Young for his age '' means only the presence of some minor characteristic not quite usual . 
Stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless there . 
An assumption of youth , or the presence of a few youthful characteristics , deceives no more successfully than rouge or dyed hair . 
`` Looking young for your age '' means `` for your age '' and it means no more . 
A mind expressing itself in words may reveal itself a little less obviously as old or young .

winds , the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf . 
Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit . 
He peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below .

Introduction Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use . 
Although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups . 
The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia . 
Report of case This patient was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . 
In 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood transfusions were given over a period of 4 years . 
Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered foci of fibrosis '' suggestive of myelofibrosis . 
No additional transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily . 
This medication was continued until February , 1958 . 
In February , 1958 , the patient suffered a myocardial infarction complicated by pulmonary edema . 
Additional findings at this time included cardiomegaly , peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans , and cholelithiasis .
