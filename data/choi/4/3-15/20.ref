The lyric beauties of Schubert 's Trout Quintet -- its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners . 
But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems . 
Since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass , an instrument generally regarded as symphonic . 
Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . 
The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing . 
Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein .

A little farther along the road you come to the Church of Santa Sabina , called the `` Pearl of the Aventine '' . 
Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the Knights of Malta . 
On the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments . 
The massive gate of the Maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in Rome . 
If you look through the keyhole , you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of St. Peter 's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees . 
Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via Di Santa Sabina and turn right on the Via Di S. Alessio , a street lined with stately homes . 
Oleanders , cypress , and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section . 
Turn left a block or so before the street ends , and then turn right down the Via Di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino . 
Here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city . 
The renaissance city to the piazza Navona and pantheon These two walks take you through the heart of Rome . 
You will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi . 
You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed , a magnificent square , the main shopping district , the Spanish Steps , and the lovely Pincian Gardens . 
By seeing such varied places , both interesting and beautiful , you will become aware of the many different civilizations Rome has lived through , and in particular , get a feel of Renaissance Rome . 
You will realize why Rome is indeed the Eternal City .

I went in Formosa I asked the same question . 
I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy . 
I never found it among any of the Chinese with whom I spoke , though granted they were , almost all , members of the official family who , presumably , harbor official thoughts . 
But I questioned , also , professional soldiers , who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian 's dreamy irredentism . 
Their answer was : it can be done , and we will do it . 
And then I put the question as pointedly as I could directly to Chiang Kai-shek : `` In America '' , I said , `` practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the Mainland . 
What evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that , and that it can be done '' ? ? 
He smiled . 
( He always smiles -- at least at visitors , I gather . 
He smiled also at a British bloke seated next to me , who asked the most asinine questions . 
I recalled sympathetically the Duke 's complaint in Browning 's `` My Last Duchess '' . 
) He smiled , and said a word or two to the interpreter , who turned to me , `` The President wonders where you are going after you leave Taipei '' ? ? 
That , I smarted , is a royal rebuff if ever there was one .

Mickie sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue . 
Al 's Little Cafe was small , dark , narrow , and filled with the mingled scent of beer , tobacco smoke , and Italian cooking . 
Hanging over the bar was an oil painting of a nude Al had accepted from a student at the Corcoran Gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke . 
The nude was small and black-haired and elfin , and was called `` Eloise '' . 
This was one place where Moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without anyone noticing him , or at least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know all the low-down . 
The other patrons were taxi drivers and art students and small shopkeepers . 
The reporters had not yet discovered that this was his hideaway . 
His friend Jane was with him . 
She was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did weigh too much and did n't own the mint . 
She was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash , and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury * . 
This meant sorting out press clippings and the like . 
Jane sat receptive and interested . 
Mickie had a pleasant glow as he said , `` You see , both of them , I mean the President and Jeff Lawrence , are romantics .

The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place . 
The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . 
The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr .. `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' . 
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . 
It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . 
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' . 
Merger proposed However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' . 
The City Purchasing Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' . 
It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem . 
Implementation of Georgia 's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury . 
It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' . 
The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department 's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes . 
`` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this money . 
The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' . 
Nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said .

history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad . 
Since the Industrial Revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed . 
Until recently . 
There have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator , willingly or not , and found he did n't like it ; ; the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work ; ; and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions . 
There have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work , to their own and the public 's dissatisfaction and loss . 
This has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology . 
The remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university `` crash '' courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates . 
But the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer . 
Some men have no talent for or interest in management ; ; forcing them into management can only create trouble . 
The old shop adage still holds : `` A good mechanic is usually a bad boss '' . 
Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success . 
Labor fights to change its collar from blue to white . 
All grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures . 
As several recent books have over-emphasized , we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world . 
What can be done for the `` individual contributor '' who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the technically oriented company ? ?

a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania . 
Any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years . 
Fortunately , it is the FHA which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress . 
Even if you live above that line , the FHA will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged . 
New simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $ 600 to $ 900 . 
Two men can often do the installation in a day . 
You can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house . 
Its upkeep ? ? 
No less an authority than the FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs .

Oersted 's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life . 
He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August 14 , 1777 . 
His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let alone educate them in a town without even a school . 
The two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; ; his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish . 
Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum . 
Oldenburg 's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town 's learned , such as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching . 
From the town surveyor , Hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects . 
The mayor of the town taught them English and French . 
Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed on to each other ; ; they read every book that they could borrow in the village . 
At 12 , Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science . 
His earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life .
