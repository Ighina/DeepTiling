part of the same arrangement , Torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the April election campaign , bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade . 
The coalition was to prove inadvisable . 
O'Banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others ' . 
He had a round , frank Irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone 's body . 
He carried three guns -- one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket -- and was equally lethal with both hands . 
He killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately . 
The police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them . 
Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol . 
He was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths . 
He had no apparent comprehension of morality ; ; he divided humanity into `` right guys '' and `` wrong guys '' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under . 
He had what was described by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality '' . 
He walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns . 
Landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly '' but he was , in fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath . 
He was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld , the roughneck king . 
O'Banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer , in the North Side 's Little Hell , close by the Sicilian quarter and Death Corner .

Hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never maintained that sex was all . 
Hemingway 's fiction is supported by a `` moral '' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension . 
And D.H. Lawrence , in Fantasia Of The Unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive . 
Though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex .

Jack Frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle ; ; in fact , a freezing autumn dulls the blaze .
The best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain , followed by sunny days and cool nights . 
Foliage pilgrimages , either organized or individual , are becoming an autumn item for more and more Americans each year . 
Below is a specific guide , keyed to the calendar . 
Nature Canada . 
Late September finds Quebec 's color at its peak , especially in the Laurentian hills and in the area south of the St. Lawrence River . 
In the Maritime provinces farther east , the tones are a little quieter . 
Ontario 's foliage is most vivid from about Sept. 23 to Oct. 10 , with both Muskoka ( 100 miles north of Toronto ) and Haliburton ( 125 miles northwest of Toronto ) holding color cavalcades starting Sept. 23 . 
In the Canadian Rockies , great groves of aspen are already glinting gold . 
New England . 
Vermont 's sugar maples are scarlet from Sept. 25 to Oct. 15 , and often hit a height in early October . 
New Hampshire figures its peak around Columbus Day and boasts of all its hardwoods including the yellow of the birches . 
The shades tend to be a little softer in the forests that blanket so much of Maine . 
In western Massachusetts and northwest Connecticut , the Berkshires are at their vibrant prime the first week of October . 
Middle Atlantic states .

Foreign policy in its total context With this enlarged role in mind , I should like to make a few suggestions : What we in the United States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world . 
We in this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context . 
We can not regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been extracted . 
Foreign policy is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad . 
That means that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in terms of the total context of our situation . 
It is the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure -- defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense . 
It is also the concern of the Department of State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active -- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce . 
We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments .

New rule no. 2 : : Do n't build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out . 
Do n't insert your components into fixed openings , they may or may not fit ; ; position your components before you close them in . 
For example : Do n't wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances . 
It 's a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place . 
Set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom . 
Do n't try to wrestle a 400-lb. tub Afj through a narrow doorway . 
Finish your plumbing before you frame it in ( most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes ) . 
Finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in . 
There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished Afj closet . 
Do n't position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction ; ; that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window . 
You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one , two , three order -- first the stud on one side , then the window , then the stud on the other side . 
Install your disappearing stair ( or stairs ) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling . 
Do n't close in your house until everything has been carried in .

emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . 
In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . 
Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . 
Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . 
A previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . 
It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . 
In addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates .

Workers of the party '' to the editor : Sir -- We are writing in reference to a recent `` suggestion '' made to the staff of the Public Health Nursing Service of Jersey City ( registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences ) . 
The day before Election Day , to which we are entitled as a legal holiday , we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as `` workers of the party '' . 
Being ethical and professional people interested in community health and well-being , we felt this was n't a function of our position . 
Such tactics reek of totalitarianism ! ! 
As we understand , this directive was given to all city and county employes . 
To our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation . 
We , therefore , considered the `` suggestion '' an insult to our intelligence , ethics , Bill of Rights , etc .. Our only obligation for this day is to vote , free of persuasion , for the person we feel is capable in directing the public . 
This is our duty -- not as nurses or city employes -- but as citizens of the United States . 
`` Plus-one '' shelters to the editor : Sir -- I read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters . 
Does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves , but ready to demand that `` the community '' help and protect them ? ? 
Community shelters are , of course , necessary for those having no space for shelter .

My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds . 
Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings . 
`` Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive '' , a boy remarked . 
`` It means that you have to get ahead '' . 
When I pressed for a purely religious definition , I encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty . 
`` I like the tradition '' , a girl said . 
`` I like to follow the holidays when they come along . 
But you do n't have to worship in the traditional way . 
You can communicate in your own way . 
As I see it , there 's no real difference between being Jewish , Catholic , or Protestant '' . 
Another teen-ager remarked : `` Most Jews do n't believe in God , but they believe in people -- in helping people '' . 
Still another boy asserted : `` To be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; ; it 's to be a good person '' . 
When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It 's the same thing '' . 
This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad .

Martin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them . 
After they have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects ; ; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely . 
The ability to think seems to increase consistently with age . 
One experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years .

Many studies indicate that elementary-school children 's interests cover the whole field of science ; ; that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events ; ; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden . 
Emotional characteristics How a child feels about himself , about other people , and about the tasks confronting him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics . 
A considerable amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not likely to do well in school subjects .

shelter , housing symbolizes social status , a sense of `` belonging '' , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being . 
For almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most Americans . 
Few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders . 
This pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics ; ; it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country . 
It is not surprising that , as spokesman for real estate interests , the National Association of Real Estate Boards ( NAREB ) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure . 
How does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or ethnic attachment ? ?
