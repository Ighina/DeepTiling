It was John who found the lion tracks . 
He found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before , and he circled once , nose to the ground , hair shooting up along his back , as it did when he was after lion or bear , and then he lifted his head and bayed , and the pack joined in , all heads high , and Jones knew it was a hot trail . 
He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain . 
This mountain was known as The Black Reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet , honeycombed with caves , top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass .

There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . 
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . 
The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . 
( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . 
) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison .

cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world . 
The useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments . 
One wonders about its applicability to people . 
Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? ? 
The answer is , of course , yes . 
For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people . 
Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes . 
But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides . 
We have ample light when the sun sets ; ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; ; we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; ; the range of our voice ignores distance . 
At what stage are social sciences then ? ? 
Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? ?

one characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . 
Much of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky 's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . 
In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages .

Miami , Fla. , March 17 . 
An out-of-town writer came up to Paul Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year . 
Now Richards , of course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go . 
He can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice versa .

capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue . 
The directors sold directly to concessionaires , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company . 
These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers . 
The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to France in company ships . 
The company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show . 
In accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians . 
The lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade of New France and Louisiana in the previous century , and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men . 
Traders from the English colonies were far more generous , and Indian loyalty turned to them . 
Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company . 
In 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony .

A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants , which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise . 
This theory eventually proved inexact . 
But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science . 
It is the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors . 
These keys are the working principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolated , or projected , to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge . 
In the autumn of 1959 , the British Broadcasting Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology . 
Three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator . 
The participants were Professor H. Bondi , professor of mathematics at King 's College , London ; ; Dr. W.B. Bonnor , reader in mathematics at Queen Elizabeth College , London ; ; Dr. R/NP.A. Lyttleton , a lecturer at St. John 's College , Cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of Cambridge ; ; and Dr. G.J. Whitrow , reader in applied mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology , London .

an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes . 
The Unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen -- as the term was then understood in the Back Bay -- and Parker was definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners . 
Ezra Stiles Gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist . 
Even so , Gannett judiciously argued , the Association could legitimately decide that Parker `` should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness '' . 
We today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations . 
One can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture to the First Church , and so to suppress it , rather than let Parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it .

the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . 
Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm 's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . 
To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . 
In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . 
These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . 
The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . 
The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . 
It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . 
Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas . 
It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's , which would confirm the date he assigns it . 
But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography ; ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 . 
When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each . 
( It makes no real difference that Braque 's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal , while Picasso 's is on canvas and eked out in oil .

Greer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . 
As a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . 
She will receive the 1961 `` Oscar '' at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . 
The only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women 's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men 's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . 
The silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center . 
The attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . 
Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because `` It 's unlike me '' . 
In private life , Miss Garson is Mrs. E.E. Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas , where they maintain an apartment , to their California home in Los Angeles ' suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos , New Mexico . 
Therefore , her wardrobe is largely mobile , to be packed at a moment 's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle . 
Her creations in fashion are from many designers because she does n't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants `` all of her pictures by one painter '' . 
A favorite is Norman Norell , however . 
She likes his classic chemise .
