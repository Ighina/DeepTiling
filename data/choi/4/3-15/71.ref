we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion . 
Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom . 
Religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed . 
How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ? 
We may feel pessimistic at the outlook . 
And yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision . 
We are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music .

Philadelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . 
Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 a year . 
He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . 
The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw 's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer . 
Williams is a defensive coach . 
Gauer works with the ends . 
Choice was expected The selection had been expected . 
Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry . 
Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . 
Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player . 
With Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing .

The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . 
An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . 
There are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . 
For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . 
For the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . 
The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 . 
The essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman .

California Democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters , party clubrooms and workers ' backyards . 
They seem darned proud of it . 
And they 're confident that the GOP , currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks , will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled machine . 
Their meeting at San Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California Democratic Council directorate . 
But it will include 200-odd officeholders , organization leaders and `` interested party people '' . 
Out of this session may come : 1 -- Plans for a dramatic , broad-scale party rally in Los Angeles next December that would enlist top-drawer Democrats from all over the country .

Stephens had written his classic `` incidents of travel '' about these regions a hundred years before , and Catherwood , who had studied Piranesi in London and the great ruins of Egypt and Greece , had drawn the splendid illustrations that accompanied the text . 
Catherwood , an architect in New York , had been forgotten , like Stephens , and Victor reconstructed their lives as one reconstructs , for a museum , a dinosaur from two or three petrified bones . 
He had unearthed Stephens 's letters in a New Jersey farmhouse and he discovered Stephens 's unmarked grave in an old cemetery on the east side of New York , where the great traveller had been hastily buried during a cholera epidemic . 
Victor had been stirred by my account of him in Makers And Finders , for Stephens was one of the lost writers whom Melville had seen in his childhood and whom I was bent on resurrecting . 
Victor had led an adventurous life . 
His metier was the American tropics , and he had lived all over Latin America and among the primitive tribes on the Amazon river .

Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at Hunter College that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints . 
Still a demurrer or two must be entered . 
Schwarzkopf is , of course , Schwarzkopf . 
For style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her . 
If the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be , it is still a beautiful instrument , controlled and flexible . 
Put to the service of lieder of Schubert , Brahms , Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way , it made its effect with ease and precision . 
But what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism . 
Instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside . 
The symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable . 
Clever light songs were overly coy , tragic songs a little too melodramatic . 
There was an extra pause here , a gasp or a sigh there , here and there an extra little twist of a word or note , all in the interest of effect . 
The result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness . 
There were stunning musical phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication . 
Miss Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist , John Wustman , often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition . 
All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills ; ; Miss Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them .

There was one fact which Rector could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny . 
As long as there were two human beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave . 
No matter how devoted a man was , no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord , he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual . 
All of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord 's servants . 
It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions . 
Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church -- his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career -- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel . 
He was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego , demanding to be satisfied , for the two were intertwined and could not be separated . 
He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated , the Communists in the village rooted out , the mission standing triumphant , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant , too . 
But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan , that man 's ambition when linked with God would be a driving , indefatigable force for good in the world .

its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236 , 66th Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States , by means of grants-in-aid , to return disabled men and women to productive , gainful employment . 
The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social Security Act in 1935 . 
Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . 
Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78th Congress in 1943 passed P.L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure . 
Recent changes . 
Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . 
To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 ( P.L. 565 ) .

he had done on his first Imperial sortie a year and a half before , Lewis trekked southeast through Red Russia to Kamieniec . 
Thence he pushed farther south than he had ever been before into Podolia and Nogay Tartary or the Yedisan . 
There , along the east bank of the Southern Bug , opposite the hamlet of Zhitzhakli a few miles north of the Black Sea , he arrived at General Headquarters of the Russian Army . 
By June 19 , 1788 , he had presented himself to its Commander in Chief , the Governor of the Southern Provinces , the Director of the War College -- The Prince . 
Catherine 's first war against the Grand Turk had ended in 1774 with a peace treaty quite favorable to her . 
By 1783 her legions had managed to annex the Crimea amid scenes of wanton cruelty and now , in this second combat with the Crescent , were aiming at suzerainty over all of the Black Sea 's northern shoreline . 
Through most of 1787 operations on both sides had been lackadaisical ; ; those of 1788 were going to prove decisive , though many of their details are obscure .
