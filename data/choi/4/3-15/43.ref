Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . 
The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . 
The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . 
These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . 
In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised .

The person who left the buggy there has never been identified . 
It was a busy street , conveniently near the shopping center , and unattended horses and wagons were often left at the curbside . 
There are , of course , many weaknesses in any case against Emma . 
She did n't like her stepmother , but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage . 
She had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed . 
She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels . 
If she avoided the train and hired a buggy , the stableman might have recognized her .

we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion . 
Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom . 
Religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed . 
How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ? 
We may feel pessimistic at the outlook . 
And yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision . 
We are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music .

St. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . 
-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . 
Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion .

briefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences . 
Then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance . 
And then the application of the count rules to the width ( horizontally ) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline . 
The very idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement .

the entrance side of the shelter , each roof beam is rested on the inside 4 inches of the block wall . 
The outside 4-inch space is filled by mortaring blocks on edge . 
The wooden bracing between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall . 
Mortar is poured between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding . 
( For details see inset , fig. 5 . 
) The first one or two roof boards ( marked `` E '' in fig. 6 ) are slipped into place across the roof beams , from outside the shelter . 
These boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams , from inside the shelter . 
Concrete blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards . 
The roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together . 
Work on the roof continues in this way . 
The last roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter .

the Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . 
The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . 
Research at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg with loadings from 8 to 120 lb . 
Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . 
Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . 
Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen hr .

. 
O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes . 
They indicated that a 4-day retention , aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 per cent BOD reduction . 
Later , Eckenfelder increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer months . 
It appeared from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume .

His eyes were old and they never saw well , but heated with whisky they 'd glare at my noise , growing red and raising up his rage . 
I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I could n't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling . 
Oh he 'd not care about the Pedersen kid . 
He 'd not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain . 
That would make him mad enough if he was sober .

70 North Providence taxpayers made appeals to the board of tax assessors for a review of their 1961 tax assessments during the last two days at the town hall in Centredale . 
These were the last two days set aside by the board for hearing appeals . 
Appeals were heard for two days two weeks ago . 
About 75 persons appeared at that time . 
Louis H. Grenier , clerk of the board , said that the appeals will be reviewed in December at the time the board is visiting new construction sites in the town for assessment purposes . 
They also will visit properties on which appeals have been made . 
Any adjustments which are made , Mr. Grenier said earlier this month , will appear on the balance of the tax bill since most of the town 's taxpayers take the option of paying quarterly with the balance due next year . 
John Pezza , 69 , of 734 Hartford Avenue , Providence , complained of shoulder pains after an accident in which a car he was driving collided with a car driven by Antonio Giorgio , 25 , of 12 DeSoto St. , Providence , on Greenville Avenue and Cherry Hill Road in Johnston yesterday . 
Mr. Giorgio had started to turn left off Greenville Avenue onto Cherry Hill Road when his car was struck by the Pezza car , police said .
