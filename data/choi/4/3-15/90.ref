it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` structuring '' experience . 
It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like '' as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . 
This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action .

Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . 
Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . 
Or , in the words of Anatole France , `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges '' . 
The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan 's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . 
The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program .

Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre . 
Most avant-garde creators , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting . 
But Robert Rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them . 
He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham 's Summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity . 
For Mr. Taylor 's Images And Reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl 's cape lined with grass . 
Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor . 
In fact , he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound . 
To raise the dancer out of his personal , pedestrian self , Mr. Nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger , environmental orbit . 
He began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be . 
He went on to use objects -- hoops , poles , capes -- which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer , who moved with them . 
The depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure . 
In each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer .

Tenure as criterion I would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by Russell Kirk ( Dec. 16 ) . 
It has to do with teachers ' salaries and tenure . 
Next September , after receiving a degree from Yale 's Master of Arts in Teaching Program , I will be teaching somewhere -- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers .

Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits ; ; they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities . 
Their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes , but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe . 
Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power . 
Thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors . 
But this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities . 
Since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living . 
The royal ritual generated power into the other world : it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world .

we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century A.D. , when an Arabic scholar , Tabit Ibn Korra ( 836-901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three . 
Thus , while it remains possible that the Babylonians and the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the Chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn up from the Middle East or the Classical World before China can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years .

The `` Lo Shu '' square as an expression of centrality The concept of the Middle Kingdom at peace , strong and united under a forceful ruler , which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of the Warring States , was finally realized by the establishment of a Chinese Empire under the Ch'in Ch'in dynasty ( 221-207 B.C . 
) . 
But this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism . 
Among the many severe measures taken by the First Emperor , Shih Huang-ti , in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hard-won national unity , was the burning of the books in 213 B.C. , with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking ; ; but , as he had a special fondness for magic and divination , he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared . 
Many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast Ch'in Ch'in palace some ten years later ; ; yet some must have survived , because the old interest in number symbolism , divination , and magic persisted on into the Han dynasty , which succeeded in reuniting China and keeping it together for a longer period ( from 202 B.C. to A.D. 220 ) . 
In fact , during the first century B.C. , an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects , finding its typical expression in the so-called `` wei books '' , a number of which were specifically devoted to the Lo Shu and related numerical diagrams , especially in connection with divination . 
However , the wei books were also destroyed in a series of Orthodox Confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605 . 
After all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the Lo Shu , which was already semisecret anyhow .

The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor . 
Indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray . 
Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive . 
A Confederate observed that the Yankees were : `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier '' . 
Another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house '' . 
A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide '' . 
Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression . 
One wrote : `` ( I am so hungry ) I could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups '' . 
A second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia `` look like the latter end of original sin and hard times '' . 
A third remarked of slowness of Southerners : `` they moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god '' . 
Still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote : `` yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget '' . 
A Yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart : `` my girl is none of your one-horse girls . 
She is a regular stub and twister , double geered . 
She is well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and Union from the muzzle to the crupper '' . 
Humor found many modes of expression .

Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , , in 1952 , a Roman Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff . 
Three agreed , but four declined and were suspended . 
After a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 . 
The peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy . 
In New York City in 1958 , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device . 
He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy . 
A year later in Albany , N.Y. , a Roman Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood Association .

artists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . 
To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . 
At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . 
Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . 
And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . 
The storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men 's minds . 
Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself . 
In the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world . 
The ninth century was in its artistic work `` the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future '' , and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated . 
The Aegean in 800 B.C . 
Geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough , detailed study which it deserves , partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations , as at Argos , are only now coming to light . 
From even a cursory inspection of its many aspects , however , the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B.C . 
. 
The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree .

The North and the South were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the Founding Fathers . 
The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee . 
The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their Union . 
Repeated efforts -- beginning with the Missouri Compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather than clear thought and timely action . 
Even so , confusion in this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century . 
Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty .
