The bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . 
The pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) . 
Another marked difference is noted here . 
The pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) . 
The bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply . 
It does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph nodes , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles -- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole .

she were not at home , Mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there . 
Sometimes , Mrs. Coolidge would close herself in the Green Suite on the second floor , and play the piano she had brought to the White House . 
Mama knew she was playing her son 's favorite pieces and feeling close to him , and did not disturb her . 
All the rest of the days in the White House would be shadowed by the tragic loss , even though the President tried harder than ever to make his little dry jokes and to tease the people around him . 
A little boy came to give the President his personal condolences , and the President gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in . 
Backstairs , the maids cried a little over that , and the standing invitation was not mentioned to Mrs. Coolidge . 
The President was even more generous with the First Lady than he had been before the tragedy . 
He would bring her boxes of candy and other presents to coax a smile to her lips . 
He brought her shawls . 
Dresses were short in the days of Mrs. Coolidge , and Spanish shawls were thrown over them . 
He got her dozens of them . 
One shawl was so tremendous that she could not wear it , so she draped it over the banister on the second floor , and it hung over the stairway . 
The President used to look at it with a ghost of a smile . 
Mrs. Coolidge spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection .

ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful . 
The buildings are mostly Georgian . 
The Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did . 
But his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures . 
He is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be . 
He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century , down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart . 
The men 's shops on Hanover 's Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven . 
And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend , toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke , are no less rakish than those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia . 
But there has always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth . 
The would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment . 
No one here pokes fun at manly virtues . 
And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League . 
It even affects the faculty . 
Thus , when Dartmouth 's Winter Carnival -- widely recognized as the greatest , wildest , roaringest college weekend anywhere , any time -- was broadcast over a national television hookup , Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb , topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a Smith girl . 
President Dickey 's golden retriever , frolicking in the snow at his feet , added to the picture of masculine informality .

the Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . 
The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . 
Research at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg with loadings from 8 to 120 lb . 
Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . 
Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . 
Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen hr .

April 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three-masted bark , Discovery , weighed anchor in St. Katherine 's Pool , London , and floated down the Thames toward the sea . 
She carried , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America . 
Seventeen months later , on September 6 , 1611 , an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay . 
When she reached port , she was found to have on board only eight men , all near starvation . 
The captain was gone , and the mate was gone . 
The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman . 
What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months ? ? 
What happened to the fourteen missing men ? ? 
These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time . 
For hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain 's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man 's desk on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports . 
All told , they offered a highly confused picture . 
But since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information . 
Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage . 
Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations .

a neutral Germany Soviets said to fear resurgence of German militarism to the editor of the New York Times : For the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large , powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity . 
The United States and Soviet Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations . 
Recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations . 
President Kennedy was right when he said , `` We shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate '' . 
I have just returned from a seven-week trip to Europe and the Far East . 
It is quite evident that the people of Western Europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war . 
The fact is that the Italians , French and British know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs . 
We have no right to criticize them , as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war . 
We should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into Berlin . 
It would be criminal folly if the Communists tried to prevent us . 
But there is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from granting de facto recognition to East Germany . 
Soviet Russia has been invaded twice by German troops in a generation . 
In the last war Russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated . 
Probable agreement The truth is that Communist Russia fears the resurgence of German militarism . 
Berlin is merely being used by Moscow as a stalking horse .

a sneer , the man spread his legs and , a third time , confronted them . 
Once more , Katie reared , and whinnied in fear . 
For a moment , boy and mount hung in midair . 
Stevie twisted and , frantically , commanded the mare to leap straight ahead . 
But the stranger was nimbler still . 
With a bold arm , he dared once more to obstruct them .

Mr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power . 
In this view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the generality of Article 1 . 
If this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction . 
Federal question jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law . 
Then in 1875 , apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the Civil War , Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- concurrently with state tribunals -- to decide cases involving federal-right questions . 
One purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference . 
Serious difficulty arose with the advent of Substantive Due Process . 
An amendment , presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves , became a `` laissez-faire '' limitation upon state economic policy . 
A flood of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of local government . 
Congress reacted with a series of measures modifying in various ways what it had granted in 1875 . 
In 1910 it required the convening of a special three-judge court for the issuance of certain injunctions and allowed direct appeals to the Supreme Court . 
Such legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter . 
In 1913 an abortive provision was made for the stay of federal injunction proceedings upon institution of state court test cases .

St. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . 
-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . 
Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion . 
He returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . 
Stepson vindicated The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman 's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . 
Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . 
Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since .

Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not . 
It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited . 
The mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways . 
On the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed .
