The bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . 
The pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) . 
Another marked difference is noted here . 
The pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) . 
The bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply . 
It does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph nodes , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles -- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole .

Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning . 
This is particularly true in site selection . 
You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; ; you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed . 
With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available . 
Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible . 
These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies . 
The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site . 
These are inexpensive and available from the U.S. Geological Society , Washington 25 , D. C .. In recent years many counties and the U.S. Forest Service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use .

history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad . 
Since the Industrial Revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed . 
Until recently . 
There have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator , willingly or not , and found he did n't like it ; ; the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work ; ; and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions . 
There have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work , to their own and the public 's dissatisfaction and loss . 
This has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology . 
The remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university `` crash '' courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates . 
But the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer . 
Some men have no talent for or interest in management ; ; forcing them into management can only create trouble . 
The old shop adage still holds : `` A good mechanic is usually a bad boss '' . 
Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success . 
Labor fights to change its collar from blue to white . 
All grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures .

you elect to use the Standard Deduction or the Tax Table , and later find you should have itemized your deductions , you may do so by filing an amended return within the time prescribed for filing a claim for refund . 
See You May Claim A Refund , Page 135 . 
The same is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should have used the Standard Deduction or Tax Table . 
The words amended return should be plainly written across the top of such return . 
When and where to file April 15 is usually the final date for filing income tax returns for most people because they use the calendar year ending on December 31 . 
If you use a fiscal year , a year ending on the last day of any month other than December , your return is due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of your tax year . 
Saturday , Sunday , or holiday . 
If the last day ( due date ) for performing any act for tax purposes , such as filing a return or making a tax payment , etc. , falls on Saturday , Sunday , or a legal holiday , you may perform that act on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday , Sunday , or legal holiday . 
Since April 15 , 1962 , is on Sunday your return for the calendar year 1961 will be timely filed if it is filed on or before Monday , April 16 , 1962 . 
If you mail A return or tax payment , you must place it in the mails in ample time to reach the district director on or before the due date . 
Declaration of estimated tax . 
If you were required to file a declaration of estimated tax for the calendar year 1961 , it is not necessary to pay the fourth installment otherwise due on January 15 , 1962 , if you file your income tax return Form 1040 , and pay your tax in full for the calendar year 1961 by January 31 , 1962 .

we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century A.D. , when an Arabic scholar , Tabit Ibn Korra ( 836-901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three . 
Thus , while it remains possible that the Babylonians and the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the Chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn up from the Middle East or the Classical World before China can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years .

The `` Lo Shu '' square as an expression of centrality The concept of the Middle Kingdom at peace , strong and united under a forceful ruler , which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of the Warring States , was finally realized by the establishment of a Chinese Empire under the Ch'in Ch'in dynasty ( 221-207 B.C . 
) .

Salem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month 's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . 
It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . 
William Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . 
At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . 
But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . 
No request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however .

the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs .. Why ? ? 
Companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies -- in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged R & D facilities , faster new product development . 
Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge . 
Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs. ? ? 
Based on our experience with clients , , we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management . 
1 . 
Problems in the market greater price-consciousness . 
There has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years ; ; there is every indication it will continue . 
Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers . 
Despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before -- traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer . 
Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : Has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? ?

eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree '' , to be sure . 
There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century . 
I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but I noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg . 
In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school and the White school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) . 
It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been going on . 
But with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired . 
For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them . 
It 's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly . 
By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ? ? 
The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North , to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that '' as James 's Christopher Newman said to his adversaries ) `` however bad I may be , you 're not quite the people to say it '' . 
In the pre-Civil War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North .

you take Mr. Hearst 's morning American at $ 10,000 a year '' , Brisbane proposed . 
`` You could come down to the office once a day , look over a few exchanges , dictate an editorial , and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary labors . 
If within one year you can make a success out of the American , you can practically name your own salary thereafter . 
Of course , if you do n't make the American a success , Hearst will have no further use for you '' . 
The blue-eyed Watson decided that he would dislike living in New York , and the deal fell through . 
Hearst 's luck was even poorer when he had a chat with Franklin K. Lane , a prominent California journalist and reform politician , whom he asked for his support . 
Lane was still burning because he had narrowly missed election as governor of California in 1902 and laid his defeat to the antagonism of Hearst 's San Francisco Examiner . 
Hearst disclaimed blame for this , but the conversation , according to Lane , ended on a tart note . 
`` Mr. Lane '' , Hearst said , `` if you ever wish anything that I can do , all you will have to do will be to send me a telegram asking , and it will be done '' . 
`` Mr. Hearst '' , Lane replied as he left , `` if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do anything , you can put the telegram down as a forgery '' . 
Hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to New York to become a father . 
On April 10 , 1904 , his first child was born , a son named George after the late Senator .

Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , , in 1952 , a Roman Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff . 
Three agreed , but four declined and were suspended . 
After a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 . 
The peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy . 
In New York City in 1958 , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device . 
He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy . 
A year later in Albany , N.Y. , a Roman Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood Association . 
Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious belief and conscience . 
These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue . 
It has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies . 
It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries . 
Where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment . 
The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation . 
The first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level . 
Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached .
