Fred wheeled him back into his room , the big one looking out on the back porch , and put him to bed , Papa told him he was very tired but that he had enjoyed greatly the trip downtown . 
`` I 've been cooped up so long '' , he added . 
Getting out again , seeing old friends , had given his spirits a lift . 
That night after supper I went back over to 48 Spruce Street -- Ralph and I at that time were living at 168 Chestnut -- and Ralph went with me . 
Papa was still elated over his afternoon visit downtown . 
`` Baby , I saw a lot of old friends I had n't seen in a long time '' , he told me , his eyes bright . 
`` It was mighty good for the old man to get out again '' . 
The next day he seemed to be in fairly good shape and still in excellent spirits .

the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . 
Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm 's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . 
To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . 
In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . 
These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . 
The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth .

You can build this vacation cottage yourself . 
It is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete in every detail . 
Because of the unique design by the architect Egils Hermanovski , you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time . 
Most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools . 
On the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage , from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim . 
In recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation cottages , we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind . 
It is a big project , not to be taken lightly .

This should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) . 
For galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste . 
This could also be used for any other skin irritation . 
Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts . 
`` Female troubles '' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier ; ; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation . 
The sufferer drinks tansy tea .

The group , upon the issuance of its first press release on December 21 , 1957 , designated itself a `` Committee of Investigation '' . 
In the course of its inquiry , it took testimony from only seven witnesses . 
It heard Bang-Jensen twice and his lawyer , Adolf A. Berle , Jr. , once . 
Its second press release was on January 15 , 1958 , and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed . 
It also implied that Paul Bang-Jensen had been irresponsible . 
On January 18 , Ernest Gross conducted a press conference at the U.N. lasting an hour . 
Here , he openly attacked Bang-Jensen and referred to his `` aberrant conduct '' . 
This conference was held despite Stavropoulos ' assurance to Adolf Berle , who was leaving the same day for Puerto Rico , that nothing would be done until his return on January 22 , except that the Secretary General would probably order the list destroyed .

She gave herself a title , Lady Diana Harrington . 
The New York D.A. gave her another , The Golden Girl of cafe society . 
Houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute . 
And Houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on September 20 , 1960 , `` Diane Harris Graham , 30 , D.O.A. , circumstances -- unusual '' . 
Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor . 
She was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top trollop who had given the world 's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour . 
She never hid the fact that she liked to play .

Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically : `` Rest assured that your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter and Spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views '' . 
Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation . 
The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey 's overseer . 
An excellent crop was expected that year . 
William , who lived in neighboring St. Mary 's parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year . 
Giffen advised acceptance of this plan , citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation .

The United States recognizes the desire of India to accumulate , as quickly as possible , a substantial part of the one million ton reserve stock of rice provided for in this Agreement to assist in stabilizing the internal markets for this commodity in India . 
Under this Agreement the first annual review of rice availabilities will be made in August 1960 . 
At that time consideration will be given to whether in the light of the United States supplies of rice available for Title 1 , disposal , India 's production , consumption and stocks of food grains , other imports from the United States and countries friendly to the United States , India 's storage capacity , and other related factors , any increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice programmed which is currently planned for procurement during the first year .

The two Governments agree that the issuance of purchase authorizations for wheat and rice providing for purchase after June 30 , 1961 , shall be dependent upon the determination by the United States Government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available under Title 1 , of the Act at that time . 
The United States Government shall have the right to terminate the financing of further sales under this Agreement of any commodity if it determines at any time after June 30 , 1961 , that such action is necessitated by the existence of an international emergency .
