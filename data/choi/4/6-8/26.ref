It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . 
While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins ' pronouncement in Pleas Of The Crown from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage . 
By making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States , 362 U.S. 525 , where the Court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . 
One need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself . 
One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . 
The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrones an unreality into a rule of law '' .

Broadway the unoriginals To write a play , the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it . 
Nowadays , more and more , all he needs is someone else 's book . 
To get started , he does not scan the world about him ; ; he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists . 
So far this season , Broadway 's premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original American stage plays . 
Best from abroad . 
Of straight dramas , there are All The Way Home , which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee novel , A Death In The Family ; ; The Wall , awkwardly based on the John Hersey novel ; ; Advise And Consent , lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller ; ; Face Of A Hero ( closed ) , based on a Pierre Boulle novel . 
The only original works attempting to reach any stature : Tennessee Williams ' disappointing domestic comedy , Period Of Adjustment , and Arthur Laurents ' clever but empty Invitation To A March .

The North and the South were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the Founding Fathers . 
The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee . 
The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their Union . 
Repeated efforts -- beginning with the Missouri Compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather than clear thought and timely action . 
Even so , confusion in this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century . 
Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty .

The first rattle of the machine guns , at 7:10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear . 
`` Sounds exactly like last time '' . 
The young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven . 
The middle-aged man said over and over , `` Why did I come here , why did I come here '' . 
Then he was sick . 
Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons , I heard the thumping of mortars .

The turn of the century , or to be more precise , the two decades preceeding and following it , marks a great change in the history of early English scholarship . 
At the bottom of this change were great strides forward in the technical equipment and technical standards of the historian . 
In archaeology , for example , the contributions of Frederick Haverfield and Reginald Smith to the various volumes of the Victoria County Histories raised the discipline from the status of an antiquarian pastime to that of the most valuable single tool of the early English historian . 
And with the publication of E.T. Leeds ' Archaeology Of The Anglo-Saxon Settlements the student was presented with an organized synthesis of the archaeological data then known . 
What was true for archaeology was also true of place-name studies . 
The value of place-names in the reconstruction of early English history had long been recognized .

The one - or two-season hunt , of which there have been too many recently , may do more harm than good ; ; for such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which are dashed when the programs are discontinued ; ; and they are dashed , no less , by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit . 
For the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good : such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected , by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time . 
The central group of the Foundation 's advisors are , at any one period of time , the members of our Advisory Board , consisting , now , of thirty-six men and women . 
They are chosen by the Foundation 's Board of Trustees on the bases of their own first-rate accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts . 
Their locations in all parts of the United States , and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are factors in the Trustees ' minds . 
For this concept of an Advisory Board , ancillary to the Board of Trustees , we are indebted to the late President of Harvard University , A. Lawrence Lowell , a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration .

Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . 
The disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . 
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . 
Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . 
Fears prejudicial aspects `` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , Bellows told the court . 
`` Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property .

Sales and net income for the year ended December 31 , 1960 showed an improvement over 1959 . 
Net income was $ 2,557,111 , or $ 3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding , as compared to $ 2,323,867 or $ 2.82 per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares . 
Sales and other operating income increased 25.1 % from $ 24,926,615 in 1959 to $ 31,179,816 in 1960 . 
This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development . 
In spite of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959 . 
Outlook for current year Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 . 
However , the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 . 
Need for sound tax policy In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery , a sounder U.S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment , enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on Leesona 's business in the next few years .

The Theatre-by-the-Sea , Matunuck , presents `` King Of Hearts '' by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke . 
Directed by Michael Murray ; ; settings by William David Roberts . 
The cast : Producer John Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season 's opener at Matunuck in Jean Kerr 's `` King Of Hearts '' . 
The dialogue is sharp , witty and candid -- typical `` do n't eat the daisies '' material -- which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays , and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience liked it . 
The story is of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material . 
This is when his troubles begin , not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires , and who turns out to have ideas of his own , with particular respect to the hero 's sweetheart-secretary .

each song he gave verbal footnotes . 
The songs Sandburg sang often reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely or in fragments . 
Often these listeners would refer Sandburg to persons who had similar ballads or ditties . 
In due time Sandburg was a walking thesaurus of American folk music . 
After he had finished the first two volumes of his Lincoln , Sandburg went to work assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him . 
He rummaged , found composers and arrangers , collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization with musicians , ballad singers , and musicologists . 
The result was a collection of 280 songs , ballads , ditties , brought together from all regions of America , more than one hundred never before published : The American Songbag . 
Each song or ditty was prefaced by an author 's note which indicated the origin and meaning of the song as well as special interest the song had , musical arrangement , and most of the chorus and verses .
