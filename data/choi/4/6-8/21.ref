That summer the gambling houses were closed , despite the threats of Pierre Ameaux , a gaming-card manufacturer . 
Dancing was no longer permitted in the streets . 
The Bordel and other places of prostitution were emptied . 
The slit breeches had to go . 
Drunkenness was no longer tolerated . 
In defiance , a chinless reprobate , Jake Camaret , marched down the aisle in St. Peter 's one Sunday morning , followed by one of the women from the Bordel , whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack of any shame .

Mr. Dooley . 
Mr. Speaker , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have . 
The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two . 
And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service . 
There have been a number of sound plans proposed . 
But none of these has been implemented . 
Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping hand .

a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania . 
Any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years . 
Fortunately , it is the FHA which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress . 
Even if you live above that line , the FHA will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged . 
New simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $ 600 to $ 900 . 
Two men can often do the installation in a day .

She gave herself a title , Lady Diana Harrington . 
The New York D.A. gave her another , The Golden Girl of cafe society . 
Houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute . 
And Houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on September 20 , 1960 , `` Diane Harris Graham , 30 , D.O.A. , circumstances -- unusual '' . 
Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor . 
She was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top trollop who had given the world 's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour .

Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics . 
Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn . 
Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor . 
Hot rodding is a science . 
It 's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science . 
But because science is based on mathematics does n't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician . 
A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems ; ; however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding . 
A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem .

Burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on in a primitive way , almost unchanged from feudal times . 
Peasants puzzled Andrei . 
He wondered how they could go on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish . 
Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long ago . 
Tolek Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine and , before the national leadership , exalted the miracles of drying up swamps and irrigating the desert . 
A fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched .

She was a child too much a part of her environment , too eager to grow and learn and experience . 
Once , they were at Easthampton for the summer ( again , Fritzie said , a good place , even though they were being robbed ) . 
One soft evening -- that marvelous sea-blessed time when the sun 's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume and wrack haunts everything -- Amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk . 
Fritzie was on the couch reading ; ; Laura was sitting in an easy chair about eight feet away . 
The infant , in white terry-cloth bathrobe , her face intense and purposeful , had essayed a few wobbly steps toward her father . 
`` Y'all wanna walk -- walk '' , he said .

There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone . 
Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the crowds and common happenstance . 
If you 've travelled in Europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you 've had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic . 
Following a guide , and gratefully so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new . 
However , after you 've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe , you 'll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places . 
The champagne at Troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour D'Argent .

Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge . 
For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned . 
One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers . 
The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David -- nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . 
Public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : Too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . 
And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot .

A shock wave from Africa Word of Dag Hammarskjold 's death in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe . 
As head of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace , and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously . 
It was on the eve of a momentous U.N. session to come to grips with cold war issues . 
His firm hand will be desperately missed . 
Mr. Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace . 
He had sought talks with Moise Tshombe , the secessionist president of Congo 's Katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody .
