The turn of the century , or to be more precise , the two decades preceeding and following it , marks a great change in the history of early English scholarship . 
At the bottom of this change were great strides forward in the technical equipment and technical standards of the historian . 
In archaeology , for example , the contributions of Frederick Haverfield and Reginald Smith to the various volumes of the Victoria County Histories raised the discipline from the status of an antiquarian pastime to that of the most valuable single tool of the early English historian . 
And with the publication of E.T. Leeds ' Archaeology Of The Anglo-Saxon Settlements the student was presented with an organized synthesis of the archaeological data then known . 
What was true for archaeology was also true of place-name studies . 
The value of place-names in the reconstruction of early English history had long been recognized .

The study of the St. Louis area 's economic prospects prepared for the Construction Industry Joint Conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan St. Louis Survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the Missouri-Illinois countryside . 
St. Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region . 
Slackened regional demand for St. Louis goods and services reflects the region 's relative lack of purchasing power . 
Not all St. Louis industries , of course , have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood . 
But for those which do , the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core . 
The city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern Illinois .

The group , upon the issuance of its first press release on December 21 , 1957 , designated itself a `` Committee of Investigation '' . 
In the course of its inquiry , it took testimony from only seven witnesses . 
It heard Bang-Jensen twice and his lawyer , Adolf A. Berle , Jr. , once . 
Its second press release was on January 15 , 1958 , and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed . 
It also implied that Paul Bang-Jensen had been irresponsible . 
On January 18 , Ernest Gross conducted a press conference at the U.N. lasting an hour . 
Here , he openly attacked Bang-Jensen and referred to his `` aberrant conduct '' . 
This conference was held despite Stavropoulos ' assurance to Adolf Berle , who was leaving the same day for Puerto Rico , that nothing would be done until his return on January 22 , except that the Secretary General would probably order the list destroyed .

He brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes , of about a hundred pounds ' weight . 
They took Jesus 's body , then , and wrapped it in winding-clothes with the spices ; ; that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial . 
Listed as present at the Descent were Mary , Mary 's sister , Mary Magdalene , John , Joseph of Arimathea , Nicodemus . 
Search as he might , he could find no place where the Bible spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus . 
Mostly the scene was crowded with mourners , such as the dramatic Dell'Arca Lamentation in Bologna , where the grief-stricken spectators had usurped Mary 's last poignant moment . 
In his concept there could be no one else present .

The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place . 
The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . 
The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr .. `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' . 
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . 
It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . 
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' .

a few school districts one finds a link between school and job . 
In those vocational programs organized with Smith-Hughes money , there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other . 
In these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 . 
The apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school . 
These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical work , tool-and-die work , and sheet-metal work . 
Formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation . 
The `` diversified occupations '' program is a part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers .

one characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . 
Much of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky 's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . 
In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages . 
Through long experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself . 
Giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words . 
The moments of sung melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and liturgical chants . 
Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- Boris ' first monologue , for example .

a pessimistic assessment of the cold war , Eden declared : `` There must be much closer unity within the West before there can be effective negotiation with the East '' . 
Ordinary methods of diplomacy within the free world are inadequate , said the former Prime Minister . 
`` Something much more thorough is required '' . 
Citing the experience of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in World War 2 , , Eden said that all would have been confusion and disarray without them . 
`` This '' , he said , `` is exactly what has been happening between the politically free nations in the postwar world . 
We need joint chiefs of a political general staff '' . 
Citing the advances of Communist power in recent years , Sir Anthony observed : `` This very grave state of affairs will continue until the free nations accept together the reality of the danger that confronts them and unite their policies and resources to meet it '' .

He looked at her as she spoke , then got up as she was speaking still , and , simply and wordlessly , walked out . 
And that was the end . 
Or nearly . 
He went to the Hotel Mayflower and telegraphed Mencken . 
Would he meet him in Baltimore in Drawing Room A , Car Three on the train leaving Washington at nine o'clock next morning ? ? 
They would go to New York together , where parties would be piled on weariness and on misery .

Harold Arlen returned to California in the winter of 1944 , it was to take up again a collaboration with Johnny Mercer , begun some years before . 
The film they did after his return was an inconsequential bit of nothing titled Out Of This World , a satire on the Sinatra bobby-soxer craze . 
The twist lay in using Bing Crosby 's voice on the sound track while leading man Eddie Bracken mouthed the words . 
If nothing else , at least two good songs came out of the project , `` Out Of This World '' and `` June Comes Around Every Year '' . 
Though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs , Arlen and Mercer were not given strong material to work on . 
Their first collaboration came close . 
Early in 1941 they were assigned to a script titled Hot Nocturne .
