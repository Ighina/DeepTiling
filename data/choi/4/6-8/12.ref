seven hills , Istanbul , like Rome , is one of the most ancient cities in the world , filled with splendor and contrast . 
It is an exotic place , so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses . 
At the moment , many of these are being pulled down . 
Whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will show off its treasures to better advantage -- the great domes and graceful spires of its mosques , the panorama of the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn . 
Even when they are finished , however , the contrast will remain , for Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon two continents . 
For almost 3,000 years Europe and Asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets . 
Founded in the Ninth Century B.C. it was called Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas , ruler of the Megarians , expanded the settlement and named it after himself .

I feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole . 
It had a single porcelain stall and but one cabinet for the chairing of the bards . 
It was here that the terror-stricken Dennis Moon played an unrehearsed role during the children 's party . 
A much larger room , adjacent to the lavatory , served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet . 
That unused room was large enough for -- well , say an elephant could get into it and , as a matter of fact , an elephant did . 
Something occurred on the morning of the children 's party which may illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused us .

Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically : `` Rest assured that your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter and Spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views '' . 
Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation . 
The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey 's overseer . 
An excellent crop was expected that year . 
William , who lived in neighboring St. Mary 's parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year . 
Giffen advised acceptance of this plan , citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation .

Her father , James Upton , was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in the famous introduction to the Scarlet Letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port . 
A gentleman of the old school , Mr. Upton possessed intellectual power , ample means , and withal , was a devoted Christian . 
The daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects . 
Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests . 
There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood had an unusual mind . 
She possessed an observant eye , a retentive memory , and a critical faculty . 
When she was nine years old , she wrote a description of a store she had visited .

Mr. Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at Loon Lake . 
The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure . 
The evening was not always spent in the same way . 
This year , on a night cool with the front of September moving in , but with plenty of summer still about , the Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod . 
The little cottage was bursting with people of all ages . 
In the midst of it all , Mr. Podger came out on the Pod porch , alone .

There was one fact which Rector could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny . 
As long as there were two human beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave . 
No matter how devoted a man was , no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord , he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual . 
All of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord 's servants . 
It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions . 
Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church -- his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career -- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel .

you simply told yourself , as you handed us the book , that it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline of incantation . 
For pride 's sake , I will not say that the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into my soul . 
Besides , that particular message does no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood . 
But what you could not know , of course , was how smoothly the Victorian Fitzgerald was to lead into an American Fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents were to come , if not of age , then into a bright , taut semblance of it . 
I do not suppose you ever heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald , living or dead , and moreover I do not suppose that , even if you had , his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval . 
Neither his appetites , his exacerbations , nor his despair were kin to yours . 
He might have been the man in the moon for all you could have understood him . 
But he was no man in the moon to me .

Trevelyan 's Liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit , a deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty . 
His passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure of Garibaldi 's exploits and give the reader a unique sense of participation in the events described . 
The three volumes brought to the fore a characteristic of Trevelyan 's prose which remained conspicuous through his later works -- a genius for describing military action with clarity and with authority . 
The confused rambling of guerrilla warfare , such as most of Garibaldi 's campaigns were , was brought to life by Trevelyan 's pen in some of the best passages in the books . 
His personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much to the final result , but familiarity alone would not have been enough without other qualities . 
Military knowledge , love of detail , and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added ingredients . 
But the Garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic story .

Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics . 
Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn . 
Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor . 
Hot rodding is a science . 
It 's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science . 
But because science is based on mathematics does n't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician . 
A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems ; ; however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding . 
A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem .

There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . 
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . 
The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . 
( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . 
) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . 
The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used .
