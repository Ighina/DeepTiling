it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible . 
The instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating . 
The force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal . 
Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness . 
This , too , is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut . 
A number of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such substrates as iron and other metals , glass , wood , and plastic surfaces . 
The measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out .

fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals . 
Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melting grease . 
Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat . 
Do n't/RB forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces . 
Clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly . 
Do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit . 
Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables , sauces and such . 
Do n't/RB fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops .

The following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record synchronizers , inquiry synchronizers , and alteration switches . 
The declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 ) . 
Continuation cards Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder coding sheet . 
When this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that `` Continuation Cards '' may be used . 
Thus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow . 
The label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ; i.e. , it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet .

Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge . 
For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned . 
One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers . 
The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David -- nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . 
Public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : Too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . 
And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot .

70 North Providence taxpayers made appeals to the board of tax assessors for a review of their 1961 tax assessments during the last two days at the town hall in Centredale . 
These were the last two days set aside by the board for hearing appeals . 
Appeals were heard for two days two weeks ago . 
About 75 persons appeared at that time . 
Louis H. Grenier , clerk of the board , said that the appeals will be reviewed in December at the time the board is visiting new construction sites in the town for assessment purposes . 
They also will visit properties on which appeals have been made . 
Any adjustments which are made , Mr. Grenier said earlier this month , will appear on the balance of the tax bill since most of the town 's taxpayers take the option of paying quarterly with the balance due next year . 
John Pezza , 69 , of 734 Hartford Avenue , Providence , complained of shoulder pains after an accident in which a car he was driving collided with a car driven by Antonio Giorgio , 25 , of 12 DeSoto St. , Providence , on Greenville Avenue and Cherry Hill Road in Johnston yesterday .

The President 's personality would have opened that office to him . 
And for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make it a successorship by inheritance . 
It is testimony to the deep respect in which Mr. Eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached . 
These began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the President 's condition for the nation . 
And if Howard Rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession , his article in the Atlantic Monthly accomplished a good deal more . 
It forced us to fix the responsibility for the position in which all medical commentators had been placed .

thermonuclear war be set off by accident ? ? 
What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ? ? 
Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? ? 
Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? ? 
Will the danger increase or decrease ? ? 
I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon , in the White House , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` Sherwood Forest '' . 
I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons '' that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons . 
To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow 's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched .

Stephens had written his classic `` incidents of travel '' about these regions a hundred years before , and Catherwood , who had studied Piranesi in London and the great ruins of Egypt and Greece , had drawn the splendid illustrations that accompanied the text . 
Catherwood , an architect in New York , had been forgotten , like Stephens , and Victor reconstructed their lives as one reconstructs , for a museum , a dinosaur from two or three petrified bones . 
He had unearthed Stephens 's letters in a New Jersey farmhouse and he discovered Stephens 's unmarked grave in an old cemetery on the east side of New York , where the great traveller had been hastily buried during a cholera epidemic . 
Victor had been stirred by my account of him in Makers And Finders , for Stephens was one of the lost writers whom Melville had seen in his childhood and whom I was bent on resurrecting . 
Victor had led an adventurous life . 
His metier was the American tropics , and he had lived all over Latin America and among the primitive tribes on the Amazon river .

Broadway the unoriginals To write a play , the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it . 
Nowadays , more and more , all he needs is someone else 's book . 
To get started , he does not scan the world about him ; ; he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists . 
So far this season , Broadway 's premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original American stage plays . 
Best from abroad . 
Of straight dramas , there are All The Way Home , which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee novel , A Death In The Family ; ; The Wall , awkwardly based on the John Hersey novel ; ; Advise And Consent , lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller ; ; Face Of A Hero ( closed ) , based on a Pierre Boulle novel . 
The only original works attempting to reach any stature : Tennessee Williams ' disappointing domestic comedy , Period Of Adjustment , and Arthur Laurents ' clever but empty Invitation To A March . 
Clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals -- A Taste Of Honey , by Britain 's young ( 19 when she wrote it ) Shelagh Delaney ; ; Becket , by France 's Jean Anouilh ; ; The Hostage ( closed ) , by Ireland 's Brendan Behan .

you take Mr. Hearst 's morning American at $ 10,000 a year '' , Brisbane proposed . 
`` You could come down to the office once a day , look over a few exchanges , dictate an editorial , and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary labors . 
If within one year you can make a success out of the American , you can practically name your own salary thereafter . 
Of course , if you do n't make the American a success , Hearst will have no further use for you '' . 
The blue-eyed Watson decided that he would dislike living in New York , and the deal fell through . 
Hearst 's luck was even poorer when he had a chat with Franklin K. Lane , a prominent California journalist and reform politician , whom he asked for his support . 
Lane was still burning because he had narrowly missed election as governor of California in 1902 and laid his defeat to the antagonism of Hearst 's San Francisco Examiner .
