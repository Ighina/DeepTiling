California Democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters , party clubrooms and workers ' backyards . 
They seem darned proud of it . 
And they 're confident that the GOP , currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks , will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled machine . 
Their meeting at San Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California Democratic Council directorate . 
But it will include 200-odd officeholders , organization leaders and `` interested party people '' . 
Out of this session may come : 1 -- Plans for a dramatic , broad-scale party rally in Los Angeles next December that would enlist top-drawer Democrats from all over the country .

A gyro-stabilized platform system , using restrained gyros , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination . 
The restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , neglecting transient effects , as follows : Afj where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro . 
The platform angle \*\* yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling . 
This is normally termed the gyro input axis , 90-degrees away from the gyro output or \*\* yj axis . 
The gyro angular momentum is defined by H . 
Thus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the \*\* yf axis , the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Afj if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Afj .

Sales and net income for the year ended December 31 , 1960 showed an improvement over 1959 . 
Net income was $ 2,557,111 , or $ 3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding , as compared to $ 2,323,867 or $ 2.82 per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares . 
Sales and other operating income increased 25.1 % from $ 24,926,615 in 1959 to $ 31,179,816 in 1960 . 
This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development . 
In spite of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959 . 
Outlook for current year Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 . 
However , the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 . 
Need for sound tax policy In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery , a sounder U.S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment , enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on Leesona 's business in the next few years .

these remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development . 
For critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith . 
This seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet : `` Domicilium '' is dated `` between 1857 and 1860 '' ; ; `` Seeing The Moon Rise '' is dated August , 1927 . 
One might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . 
This is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . 
In a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency .

The reading public , the theatergoing public , the skindiving public , the horse-playing public -- all these and others fill substantial roles in U.S. life , but none is so varied , vast and vigilant as the eating public . 
The Department of Agriculture averaged out U.S. food consumption last year at 1,488 lbs. per person , which , allowing for the 17 million Americans that John Kennedy said go to bed hungry every night , means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs. or more a day . 
That mother hen of the weight-height tables , the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. , clucks that 48 million Americans are overweight . 
Through previous centuries , eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees , and mostly toward just getting enough . 
Now big forces buffet food . 
For the first time in history , the U.S. has produced a society in which less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much food that the Government 's most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce .

Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I 'm sorry , but we do n't have that book . 
There would n't be much demand for it , I 'm afraid '' . 
Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . 
What to buy out of the year 's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? 
What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? 
Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . 
A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $ 500 annually , which includes the librarian 's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world 's richest city .

The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . 
Gary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . 
Arnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . 
`` Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . 
And that is just what happened on the last few holes . 
The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer .

American romance , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called `` meeting cute '' -- that is , boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it does n't take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom . 
Just about the most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga : reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts , but he said simultaneously , `` I wish they were emeralds '' . 
Aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts , especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on . 
The way MacArthur said his line -- if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist -- would probably have gone like this : Afj Primary stresses on emeralds and wish ; ; note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness . 
Conclusions : The people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental . 
And the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture .

capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue . 
The directors sold directly to concessionaires , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company . 
These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers . 
The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to France in company ships . 
The company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show . 
In accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians .

you simply told yourself , as you handed us the book , that it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline of incantation . 
For pride 's sake , I will not say that the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into my soul . 
Besides , that particular message does no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood . 
But what you could not know , of course , was how smoothly the Victorian Fitzgerald was to lead into an American Fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents were to come , if not of age , then into a bright , taut semblance of it . 
I do not suppose you ever heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald , living or dead , and moreover I do not suppose that , even if you had , his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval . 
Neither his appetites , his exacerbations , nor his despair were kin to yours . 
He might have been the man in the moon for all you could have understood him . 
But he was no man in the moon to me .
