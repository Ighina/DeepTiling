Sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called `` Oakwood Heights '' . 
As a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $ 14,000 range . 
But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular . 
Its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point . 
This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation , with principal offices in New York State . 
Its president is Otis M. Waters , partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters , 540-K Chrysler Bldg. , New York City .

The most surprising thing about the Twenty-second Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is that it is surprising -- perhaps quite as much , in its own way , as the Twentieth Congress of 1956 , which ended with that famous `` secret '' report on Stalin . 
The publication last July of the party 's Draft Program -- that blueprint for the `` transition to communism '' -- had led the uninitiated to suppose that this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the Khrushchev regime , a solemn consecration of ideas which had , in fact , been current over the last three or four years ( i.e. , since the defeat of the `` anti-party group '' ) in all theoretical party journals . 
These never ceased to suggest that if , in the eyes of Marx and Lenin `` full communism '' was still a very distant ideal , the establishment of a Communist society had now , under Khrushchev , become an `` immediate and tangible reality '' . 
It seems that Khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent Congress was , in fact , very largely a rehash of that interminable document ) . 
He and other Soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas , such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an `` All People 's State '' , and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater `` democratization '' of the whole hierarchy of Soviets , starting with the Supreme Soviet itself . 
Their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at `` bureaucracy '' and would enable `` the people '' to take a more direct and active part in running the country . 
Also , elections would be more democratic ; ; there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from .

a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents do n't want sonny-boy to `` lift all those old barbell things '' because `` you 'll stunt your growth '' or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like `` Hey lookit Mr. America ; ; whaddya gonna do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time ) '' ? ? 
After all , a guy 's gotta have a little ego ! ! 
Therefore it 's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ! ! 
This happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr. Canada -- Henri De Courcy . 
Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments . 
Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority , Professor Roland Claude .

Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning . 
This is particularly true in site selection . 
You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; ; you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed . 
With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available . 
Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible . 
These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies . 
The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site . 
These are inexpensive and available from the U.S. Geological Society , Washington 25 , D. C .. In recent years many counties and the U.S. Forest Service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use .

Local industry 's investment in Rhode Island was the big story in 1960 's industrial development effort . 
Fifty-two companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction , totaling 1,418,000 square feet and representing an investment of $ 11,900,000 ; ; a new post-World War 2 , record . 
With minor exceptions , this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here . 
What made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation , Rhode Island scored marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs . 
Of the major expansions in 1960 , three were financed under the R/NP.I. Industrial Building Authority 's 100 % guaranteed mortgage plan : Collyer Wire , Leesona Corporation , and American Tube & Controls . 
Leading firms that arranged their own financing included Speidel Corporation , Cornell-Dubilier , Photek , Inc . 
Division of Textron , Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry , W.R. Cobb Company , and Mays Manufacturing Company . 
Expansion and relocation of industry in Rhode Island is the direct responsibility of the Development Council 's Industrial Division , and the figures quoted above indicate a successful year 's operation .

The U.N. 's ' gravest crisis ' Ambassador Stevenson yesterday described the U.N. 's problem of electing a temporary successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as `` the gravest crisis the institution has faced '' . 
Of course it is . 
If the decision goes wrong , it may be -- as Mr. Stevenson fears -- `` the first step on the slippery path downhill '' to a U.N. without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning . 
The integrity of the office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be , as the Charter puts it , `` the chief administrative officer of the Organization '' , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority `` external to the Organization '' . 
In other words , the Secretary General is to be a nonpartisan , international servant , not a political , national one . 
He should be , as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was , a citizen of the world . 
The Charter does stipulate that `` due regard '' shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on `` as wide a geographical basis as possible '' . 
The United States and its allies have had no objection to this .

There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement . 
You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before . 
I ca n't tell when , but I 'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! ! 
This experience will have happened to many of you . 
Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' . 
Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences . 
In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually . 
When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja vue , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar .

The Summary Report On Desegregation Progress In Education In The Middle-South Region , 1959 - 1960 '' clearly shows two pieces of information . 
The Summary Report , which was prepared for this Conference , indicates , first , that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing ; ; second , that both actual and pending desegregation is , with few exceptions , the product or result of court order . 
The Report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow . 
The Middle-South Region , as defined by the National Association of Intergroup Relations Officials ( NAIRO ) , consists of the states of Kentucky , Maryland , Tennessee , West Virginia , Delaware , Virginia and the District of Columbia . 
The states and the Nation 's Capital all have some desegregation , in fact some dating back to 1954 ; ; but the region also embraces some of the staunchest opposition . 
Desegregation has been opposed by massive resistance , interposition , pupil assignment ( with no assignments of Negro children ) , and hate bombings . 
Desegregation and court order Now let 's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order . 
First Kentucky .

The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky . 
The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no more . 
The things left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows . 
Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and then empty of images . 
They slept -- Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring , the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table . 
In the ballroom below , the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows . 
It was a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky .

It will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required , because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages enumerated in Table 1 . 
Great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network . 
By monitoring , we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers . 
As a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types , question , command , statement , or exclamation . 
For example , suppose a man wearing a $ 200 watch , driving a 1959 Rolls Royce , stops to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` What time is it '' ? ? 
This sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car . 
If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation . 
Also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command .
