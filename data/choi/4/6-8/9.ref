Ghost town ? ? 
To the editor of the Inquirer : I just wish to congratulate Inspector Trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles . 
We have now a quiet city , fewer automobiles , less congestion , and fewer retail customers shopping in center city . 
Good for Mr. Trimmer . 
Maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a `` ghost '' town . 
Defends big trucks to the editor of the Inquirer : I worked on the Schuylkill Expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there would n't be an Expressway .

Another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively non-volatile . 
This work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method , and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago . 
Similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride . 
The development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion . 
In one of these , an exploding-wire device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 Afj and 100 atmospheres pressure , a major goal was achieved . 
The accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent . 
This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals .

You have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the Congress he has seen the Kaisers and the Hitlers and the Mussolinis , the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs , come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest Nation that mankind has ever known . 
Then I have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people . 
So , I say , Mr. Speaker , God bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the United States of America and the free world . 
You remember the words of President Kennedy a week or so ago , when someone asked him when he was in Canada , and Dean Rusk was in Europe , and Vice President Johnson was in Asia , `` Who is running the store '' ? ? 
And he said , `` The same fellow who has been running it , Sam Rayburn '' . 
General leave to extend Mr. McCormack .

She was just another freighter from the States , and she seemed as commonplace as her name . 
She was the John Harvey , one of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the U.S. Fifteenth Air Force , to Field Marshal Montgomery 's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of Italy in that early December of 1943 . 
The John Harvey arrived in Bari , a port on the Adriatic , on November 28th , making for Porto Nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city 's new and modern harbor . 
Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole . 
If anyone thought of the John Harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried . 
Which was poison gas . 
It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront . 
For in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud , poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons .

Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics . 
We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry . 
The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality . 
When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering . 
The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities . 
The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery .

a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home was called `` locatin ' '' 'em 'em . 
To keep 'em 'em scattered somewhat and yet herd 'em 'em was called `` loose herdin ' '' . 
To hold 'em 'em in a compact mass was `` close herdin ' '' . 
Cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted . 
That became their `` home range '' . 
Yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out , seekin ' grass and water . 
These became `` strays '' , the term bein ' restricted to cattle , however , as hosses , under like circumstances , were spoken of as `` stray hosses '' , not merely `` strays '' . 
Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over .

the Westminster KC Dog Show in Madison Square Garden , New York on the second day , the Finals of the Junior Class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this Class . 
The Class had entries from as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Kentucky . 
This year several entries from Canada were entered which made the Junior Class International . 
Forty-six of the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries were present . 
It was interesting to note that many of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior Class . 
As has been the custom for the past several years , John Cross , Jr. , Bench Show Chmn. of Westminster , arranged for the Juniors ' meeting before the Class , and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them . 
Over 60 Juniors , parents and guests attended . 
Mrs. William H. Long , Jr. speaks After the Juniors were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the Finals of the Junior Class , Mrs. William H. Long , Jr. was introduced as the first speaker .

ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful . 
The buildings are mostly Georgian . 
The Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did . 
But his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures . 
He is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be . 
He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century , down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart . 
The men 's shops on Hanover 's Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven . 
And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend , toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke , are no less rakish than those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia .

the New Frontier has brought to Washington a group more varied in background and interest . 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk , a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills College dean , has headed the Rockefeller Foundation and in that role expended large sums for international cultural exchange . 
One of his initial acts in office was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs . 
( `` In the late forties and fifties '' , Coombs has declared in defining his role , `` two strong new arms were added to reinforce United States foreign policy economic assistance and military assistance . 
As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity to build a third strong arm , aimed at the development of people , at the fuller realization of their creative human potential , and a better understanding among them '' . 
) Many of the new appointees are art collectors .

Oslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . 
This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . 
In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems . 
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . 
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . 
Explosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . 
The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council .
