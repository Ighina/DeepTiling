The fall of Rome , the discovery of precious metals , and the Protestant Reformation were all links and could only be explained and understood by comprehending the links that preceded and those that followed . 
Often the historian must consider the use of intuition or instinct by those individuals or nations which he is studying . 
Unconsciously , governments or races or institutions may enter into some undertaking without fully realizing why they are doing so . 
They react in obedience to an instinct or urge which has itself been impelled by natural law . 
A court may strike down a law on the basis of an intuitive feeling that the law is inimical to the numerical majority . 
A nation may go to war on some trifling pretext , when in reality it may have been guided by an unconscious instinct that its very life was at stake . 
When the historian encounters a situation in which he can perceive no visible cause and effect sequence , he should be alert to intuition and unconscious instinct as possible guides .

Temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - 90-degrees-F ( 29 - 32-degrees-C ) . 
The top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs .. Sixty lbs. loading is possible but 40 lbs. is adequate . 
The suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe ( thus returning suds to soap box ) and the machine is started . 
The 160-ml. bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen . 
Washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls . 
At the conclusion of the washing , 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-F ( 32 \* 0C. ) are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs , 4 liters to each tub . 
This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes .

recent months , much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future . 
And yet , despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole . 
The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle . 
This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier , and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level . 
In the electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets . 
Factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959 . 
The total value of our industry 's shipments , at factory prices , increased from $ 9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately $ 10.1 billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business -- home entertainment , military , industrial , and replacement . 
I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 .

The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor . 
Indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray . 
Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive . 
A Confederate observed that the Yankees were : `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier '' . 
Another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house '' . 
A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide '' . 
Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression .

these remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development . 
For critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith . 
This seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet : `` Domicilium '' is dated `` between 1857 and 1860 '' ; ; `` Seeing The Moon Rise '' is dated August , 1927 . 
One might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . 
This is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . 
In a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . 
Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not despise us : it only neglects us '' ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . 
And though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one .

they all said , `` No , your time will come . 
Enjoy being a bride while you can '' . 
There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning House ( where the Albright boys always took their brides , till they could get a house and a farm of their own ) . 
So when the Big House filled up and ran over , the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes . 
And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do . 
So Linda Kay gave up asking , and accepted her reprieve . 
Without saying so , she was really grateful ; ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joe 's wife . 
She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it spotless and neat , shabby as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe .

George Kennan 's account of relations between Russia and the West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of World War 2 , is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years . 
It combines qualities that are seldom found in one work : Scrupulous scholarship , a fund of personal experience , a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era 's great historical issues . 
In short , the book , based largely on lectures delivered at Harvard University , is both reliable and readable ; ; the author possesses an uncommonly fine English style , and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time . 
If Mr. Kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals , if his analysis of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic -- well , the record itself is not too encouraging . 
Mr. Kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken . 
But he rejects , perhaps a little too sweepingly , the theory that disloyal and pro-Communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the Yalta Conference in February , 1945 . 
After all , Alger Hiss , subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret State Department documents to Soviet agents , was at Yalta . 
And Harry Dexter White , implicated in F.B.I. reports in Communist associations , was one of the architects of the Morgenthau Plan , which had it ever been put into full operation , would have simply handed Germany to Stalin .

It was a fortunate time in which to build , for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art . 
The architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas 's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city . 
Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes . 
At the heart of all of this was the square , which one such traveler declared to be `` as spacious , as pleasant and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe '' . 
In time Isfahan came to be known as `` half the world '' , Isfahan nisf-i-jahan . 
In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of London , started to decline . 
The Afghans invaded ; ; the Safavids fell from power ; ; the capital went elsewhere ; ; the desert encroached . 
Isfahan became more of a legend than a place , and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old Persia and sometimes of the East .

the wine waiter in a restaurant -- always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself , the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one 's dealer , and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him . 
In instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity , the situation is ideal . 
It may , on occasion , be anything but that . 
However , by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice , one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines ( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters ) and , better yet , whether he has a taste for wine . 
Again , by spreading one 's purchases over several wine dealers , one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad . 
This is important because , despite all the efforts of the French government , an appreciable segment of France 's export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty , and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas . 
A good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards , or the best parts of them ; ; he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends -- sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district . 
These are the wines the French themselves use for everyday drinking , for even in France virtually no one drinks the Grands Crus on a meal-to-meal basis .
