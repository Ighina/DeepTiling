The thermal exchange of chlorine between Afj and liquid Afj is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180-degrees and above . 
The photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65-degrees using light absorbed only by the Afj . 
In the gas phase , with Afj of Afj and Afj of Afj , quantum yields of the order of Afj have been observed at 85-degrees . 
Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction . 
It appears possible to set a lower limit of about Afj for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form Afj radical . 
The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions . 
Introduction Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data .

Hotel Escape 's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` Kings 4 , Plus Two '' . 
This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch . 
Show spotlights the Kings -- George Worth , Bill Kay , Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson , flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens . 
The Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid . 
In the comedy division , the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props . 
Net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick .

St. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . 
-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . 
Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion . 
He returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . 
Stepson vindicated The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman 's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . 
Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . 
Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . 
When the verdict came in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said : `` I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed .

Mickie sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue . 
Al 's Little Cafe was small , dark , narrow , and filled with the mingled scent of beer , tobacco smoke , and Italian cooking . 
Hanging over the bar was an oil painting of a nude Al had accepted from a student at the Corcoran Gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke . 
The nude was small and black-haired and elfin , and was called `` Eloise '' . 
This was one place where Moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without anyone noticing him , or at least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know all the low-down . 
The other patrons were taxi drivers and art students and small shopkeepers . 
The reporters had not yet discovered that this was his hideaway .

This should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) . 
For galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste . 
This could also be used for any other skin irritation . 
Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts . 
`` Female troubles '' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier ; ; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation . 
The sufferer drinks tansy tea .

Sentiment . 
Tension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . 
One of the devices for tension management is preferential mating . 
The preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study . 
The relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating . 
It would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society . 
The supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation .

All of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work . 
Is the Oedipus complex , the clinical syndrome , material for a tragedy ? ? 
If we remove ourselves for a moment from our time and our infatuation with mental disease , is n't there something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile neurosis ? ? 
I am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst 's consulting room , but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies than tragedy in life . 
A man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure in love , only makes us a little weary of man ; ; his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial . 
Now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history . 
We can also argue that the three brothers Karamazov and Smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , Dostoevsky , a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father 's woman .

the term of service in Japan , each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community . 
The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support for this program . 
Musical activities the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life . 
Extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining , under skilled direction , the Choir , the Orchestra , the Band , the Glee Club , and smaller ensembles of wind and string players . 
All students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they qualify . 
Orchestra , Band , and Choir have auditions during the week preceding the first day of classes . 
The Glee Club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership .

one time , to most Americans , unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water , boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen , rich people , and the United States Navy . 
Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport . 
There are more than 8,000,000 recreational boats in use in the United States with almost 10,000,000 the prediction for within the next decade . 
About 40,000,000 people participated in boating in 1960 . 
Boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea . 
Boats are operated in every state in the Union , with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in the Middle West . 
The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident , expectedly , in the areas where boats have always been found : the natural lakes , rivers , and along the nation 's coastline .

The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects . 
For their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered . 
In this sequence I shall write about them in the order of their erection . 
The first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part , -- and perhaps the most interesting one , connected Newbury ( now Newburyport ) with Salisbury Point . 
Its building was first proposed in 1791 , when a group of citizens , mostly Newburyport men , petitioned the General Court for an act of incorporation . 
This document began : `` No. 1 Newbury Port , may 30th , 1791 `` Whereas , a Bridge over Merrimack River , from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf , Esquire , in Newbery , to Deer Island , and from said Island to Salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by affording a safe Conveyance to Carriages , Teams and Travellers at all seasons of the year , and at all Times of Tide . 
`` We , the Subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to this , or a similar Writing , We will present a petition to the Hon'ble General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , praying for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge , and a Right to demand a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge , and on like Terms , and if such an Act shall be obtained , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares set against our respective Names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times and in such Manners , as by the said proposed Corporation , shall be directed and required '' .
