Another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively non-volatile . 
This work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method , and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago . 
Similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride . 
The development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion . 
In one of these , an exploding-wire device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 Afj and 100 atmospheres pressure , a major goal was achieved . 
The accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent . 
This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals . 
The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter .

this enumeration is , it barely hints at the diverse perceptions of Jews , collectively or individually , that have been attested by their Gentile environment . 
It is reasonable to affirm two propositions : Jews have been perceived by non-Jews as all things to all men ; ; some Jews have in fact been all things to all men . 
In the arena of power Jews have at one time or another been somebody 's ally ; ; they have observed correct neutrality ; ; they have been someone 's enemy . 
In the market place Jews have in fact under various circumstances been valued customers and suppliers , or clannish monopolists and cutthroat competitors . 
And so on through the roles referred to in the previous paragraph . 
Diversity of perception , yes ; ; diversity of fact , yes . 
But the two do not invariably or even typically coincide . 
The `` conventional '' image of a particular time and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as established over the years by scholarly and scientific research .

Franklin D. Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs. Claire Shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in Bakersfield , California , several months ago as a prospective patient . 
`` Doctor '' Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes . 
Then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze . 
She had -- he informed her -- kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder . 
( He explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it . 
) He knew just the thing for her -- a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator '' machine . 
As he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer 's body , Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo . 
Yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her .

Murray Louis and his dance company appeared at the Henry Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work , `` Signal '' , and the repetition of an earlier one , `` Journal '' . 
`` Signal '' is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais . 
Its abstract decor is by John Hultberg . 
Program note reads as follows : `` Take hands ; ; this urgent visage beckons us '' . 
Here , as in `` Journal '' , Mr. Louis has given himself the lion 's share of the dancing , and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements . 
Indeed , both `` Journal '' and `` Signal '' qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics .

The Bishop looked at him coldly and said , `` Take it or leave it '' ! ! 
Literally , there was nothing else to do . 
He was caught in a machine . 
But Sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly : `` Let 's go and see what it 's like '' . 
Annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham , near the Georgia border and on the Tallahoosa River , a small and dirty stream . 
The city was a center of manufacture , especially in textiles , and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings , a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama . 
But it had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived -- servants and laborers huddled together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime . 
Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city over ; ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were .

one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of Meynell , Thompson told Patmore of his distress at having had to leave London before this new friendship had developed further : `` That was a very absurd and annoying situation in which I was placed by W. M. 's curious methods of handling me . 
He never let me know that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning I was to leave for Lymington . 
The result was that I found myself in the ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for the next week , only two days before my departure from London . 
Luckily both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not I '' . 
It need hardly be remarked that Thompson was not generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements , which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant . 
When Thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which included fervent verses from Pantasaph , Mrs. King felt a proper Victorian alarm . 
Some , she knew , looked upon Thompson almost as a saint , but others read in `` The Hound Of Heaven '' what they took to be the confessions of a great sinner , who , like Oscar Wilde , had -- as one pious writer later put it -- thrown himself `` on the swelling wave of every passion '' .

the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . 
Several factors contributed to this change . 
The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . 
Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . 
Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . 
International law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . 
Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared . 
In both respects , international law was Europeanized .

The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion . 
The architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . 
Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education . 
It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . 
The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . 
This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer 's training .

An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . 
First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . 
Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . 
All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . 
The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . 
Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . 
However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances . 
A third aspect , and probably the one open to most controversy , is the results of the election .

reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . 
And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . 
One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . 
Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . 
Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . 
The double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . 
For more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses .
